TODO:

 [x] switch client server role for worker.py!

 [ ] (not sure I want to do this) properly spoof stdout/stderr.  This
     is done right in class SageSpoofOut(SageObject): that is in
     http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/12415/12415_inprogress.patch
     and I've copied to spoof.txt in this directory temporarily.

 [ ] write Frontend

      [ ] write frontend.py server (flask + SQLalchemy version)

          [x] design an extensible data model that is simple enough to implement but
              powerful enough to be interesting and later extend to full
          [x] implement sqlalchemy database, copying from my old frontend.py code
          [ ] design a client/server setup that works with the data model
          [ ] implement frontend server part of model a bit
          [ ] implement desktop client (not polished) a bit
          [ ] implement mobile client (not polished) a bit

      [ ] write static/sagews/desktop/frontend

      [ ] write static/sagews/mobile/frontend

 [ ] write backend.py

      [x] unix domain sockets client/server using tornado non-blocking sockets
      [ ] implement basic backend desktop client (not polished)
      [ ] implement basic backend mobile client (not polished)

 [ ] write worker.py 
      [w] register self with backend web server on startup, via a post request

 [ ] implement deployment setup on Linux:
      [ ] n identical small chroot jails with maybe 1GB image each; 
          - the jail will "export" a unix domain socket, via a hardlink
          - jail runs one worker.py process
          - worker registers itself with backend  -- http://localhost:80
          - at most one user per jail
      [ ] process that starts/stops/resets jails, based on need.
          - copy clean "1GB?" image file

DONE:  
  
 [x] Test: get process.py to doctest (possibly explicitly from command line)

 [x] Test: create file test.py that:
      (1) when run with no args, runs all test suites
      (2) when run with args, tests only those modules

 [x] store process-port.pid file somewhere else.
