Components
----------

- Sage Session Server: serves a compute session that pushes results.

  API: 

   - new_session(push) --> id

   - execute(id, code) --> exec_id
   - interrupt(id)
   - status(id)

   - put(id, path, content):  creates file
   - get(id, path)     --> file
   - delete(id, path) 
   - files(id)         --> list of filenames
   
- simple.py -- a reference implementation of the above API.       

NEXT PLAN: Implement scalable http-based version of the above API. 

Components:

  - frontend_XXX.py -- A scalable web server that provides each of the
    above functions.  Scalable in the sense that it will of necessity
    queue up computations in a SQLAlchemy-based database and use
    memcache.

    [ hundreds of requests per second ]
    [     from appengine (say)        ]

    [ 10-100s of Python processes (as different uid than frontend) ]
    [     running on same machine ]

 [ ] define simplest possible message protocol between frontend and
     python process:

         frontend --> process:
              - execute(code)

         process --> frontend:
              - put(my_id, mesg)
                 mesg = {'output':..., 'modified_files':..., 'done':...}
             
 [ ] implement message protocol between frontend and python process

 [ ] write unit/doctests for messaging
 [ ] define the data model for the frontend
 [ ] write sqlalchemy code for the frontend model
 [ ] implement using flask the frontend webserver
 [ ] write unit/doctests for frontend
