# @cocalc/crm

Experimental backend support for CRM functionality will go here, maybe built on
NocoDB. If this works out, we'll do a lot more in this direction. If not, we'll
restart and write our own at a lower level.

This package is NOT built by default. Unlike everything else in all of CoCalc,
it is the one package where something it installs is AGPL licensed. Thus we
avoid installing it by default and make its use optional.
