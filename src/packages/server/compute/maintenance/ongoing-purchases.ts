- For all compute servers, it makes sure that the state of the purchases matches
  the state of the compute server.  E.g. if a compute server moves from running

  is supposed to start.   This should always happen, but just in case it doesn't
  happen for some reason (e.g., database connectivity issue?), we ensure it happens
  here.  To avoid interferring with proper functioning, we only consider state
  changes that are at least MIN_STATE_CHANGED_WAIT_MS old.
