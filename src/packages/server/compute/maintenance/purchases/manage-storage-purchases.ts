/*
For cloud filesystem purchases we have to do these things:

  - We periodically split long purchases so they don't exceed 1 day

  - Around 2 days (actually GOOGLE_COST_LAG_MS) after the purchase ends,
    we fill in the actual cost via computeBucketPurchaseCosts, which queries
    the BigQuery detailed billing export.

TODO: Later we will also fill in monitoring data to produce cost estimates
and potentially require extra funds to be available.
