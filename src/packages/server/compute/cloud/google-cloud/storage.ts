It is VERY tricky to efficiently delete all files in a bucket on Google Cloud Storage.
Most guides suggest that you MUST delete each file one by one.
There is a method bucket.deleteFiles, but if you look up the source
code it just grabs every object, then does a separate API call to delete it,
and this is slow for a large number of files.
The juicefs format command is basically the same
and only deletes a few dozen objects per second.  Fortunately,
there is a major new trick on the block!!  One of the answers at
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29840033/fast-way-of-deleting-non-empty-google-bucket
mentions using the new "Storage Transfer Service", and this really
is significantly faster than other approaches, probably due to
everything just being kept close, etc.

This takes about 25 seconds of overhead, but then deletes objects
at a rate of about 300/second in my test.  That stackoverlow has numbers that
are much larger, but maybe their situation is different.
I got only 30-40/second with the same parameters using juicefs format, etc.
