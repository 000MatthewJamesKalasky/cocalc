# The Share Server

This is a next.js app, which is used as part of CoCalc to provide the share server.

To develop the share server, mostly just edit code here and it will automatically reload (hot module reloading) without you having to refresh the page.  As long as you're not changing basic configuration, you don't have to restart the hub.

You don't need to start your own nextjs server here -- the hub handles that.
