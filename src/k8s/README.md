## Quickstart

To get started, go the cluster directory and type

    ./control.py create mycluster  # creates the cluster (about 5 min)
    ./control.py run               # creates all images and runs them (about 10 min)

When you're done, type

    ./control.py delete mycluster  # deletes everything (about 5 min)
