###
Compute client for use in Kubernetes cluster by the hub.

The hub uses this module to get information about a project.  This is meant
to be used as part of kucalc, and replaces the other variants
of compute-client.coffee.

The name 'compute-client' probably isn't the best.  Really this is a module
that gets information about and controls projects.
