The hub CoCalc web server.

This code is part of https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc and isn't currently designed to be used standalone. Our plan is to refactor this code into smaller useful modules that are published under the @cocalc npm organization.


Run the dev server, suitable for use inside a CoCalc project:
```sh
npm run dev
```

Run the hub server for use from cocalc-docker:
```sh
npm run docker
```
