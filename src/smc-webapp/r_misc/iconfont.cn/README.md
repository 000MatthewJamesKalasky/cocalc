These are from iconfont:

https://www.iconfont.cn/manage/index?manage_type=myprojects&projectId=2576353

The steps are:

1. Make a shopping cart with a bunch of icons
2. Add them to a project
3. Download the code of a project (the js).
4. Upload the js file in that zip download here.

I don't know if we can have multiple js files or if it will only
work to have one large file.  If so, we would update `index.js` here.
