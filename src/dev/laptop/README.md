# Development inside an SMC project

Scripts for doing development of SMC on a personal single-user laptop that you fully control.  You _**must not**_ have anything else listening on ports 5000, 5001, 8080, 28015 and 29015.

## The servers

Start each of the following scripts in their own terminal session:
