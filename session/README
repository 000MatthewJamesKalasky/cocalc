TESTING
-------

All code includes both 100% doctests written using the standard Python
doctest format, and unit tests.  The point of the doctests is to
ensure that every function is tested and that it is easy to
interactively try out any given function.  The unit tests ensure that
more complicated examples behave as they should.


To run the test suite, install py.test (see http://pytest.org/) and
run the command

   py.test simple.py
