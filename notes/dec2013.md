# High Availability!

 - [ ] (0:45?) It turns out that sparse file support is totally busted on xfs! switch all gluster bricks to ext4 and remake the volumes.  UGH.

   - this is complicated since rebalancing sounds highly unlikely to "work".
   - just making a huge image doesn't work -- there seems to be a kvm/qcow2/etc (?) limits of 2TB.
   - ext4 + lvm is what I can use!  Then I can add new qcow2 images to just dynamically grow bricks
     as space is needed on a node.    I just can't add new machines.  OK.
   - and I absolutely must do this on the GCE nodes too.
   - STEPS:
       - make it so each gluster node has a 256GB ext4 image attached and working.
       - figure out how on the command line...
       - UGH -- my lvm stuff won't persist since it is in /
       - an advantage to using LVM is *snapshots* -- I could snapshot the whole gluster system, just in case (?)

   - [x] (0:20?) add option to vm.py to not mount or format a persistent image.
   - [x] (0:50?) (0:43) add custom fstab option to vm.py and admin.py and use to configure expandable lvm brick stuff on gluster1 and test

      vgcreate gluster /dev/vdc
      lvcreate -n /dev/gluster/brick1 -l 100%FREE  gluster
      lvdisplay gluster
      mkfs.ext4 /dev/gluster/brick1

          # this fstab line goes in conf file:   /dev/gluster/brick1 /mnt/brick1 ext4 nobootwait 0 2

   - [x] (0:30?) push out vm.py to all and start new gluster cluster running
   - [x] (0:10?) test sparse copy; verify works right.
   - [x] (1:00?) (0:40) get the gce machines working and with lvm setup.

      vgcreate gluster /dev/sdb2
      lvcreate -n /dev/gluster/brick1 -l 100%FREE  gluster
      lvdisplay gluster
      mkfs.ext4 /dev/gluster/brick1

- [ ] inotify based sync, version 0 -- just run one on every node?

--> - timing test with devel project

- [x] sync -- any advantage to many small images?
        not every file is touched always, but mount is *much* slower!

- [ ] sync -- use "rsync --inplace" when the destination file already exists versus cp?  Threshold?

      - weird thing: if I make a large sparse file, then cp it to a glusterfs volume, the result is much less sparse?!
      - trying rsync --sparse on same file now.

       - it turns out rsync disables delta-xfer on "local" paths, so we have to *explicitly* force it back... but this
         might cause rsync to read the entire target file into memory anyways, which is "over the network" and way worse.  Hmm.
         We could also try to write to all bricks simultaneously.  That seems very bad.

             time rsync -axvH --inplace --no-whole-file 37/02/3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b/   /mnt/dc1-projects/37/02/3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b/

    what is the right thing to do?

    Idea:

      - run one sync on every other brick
      - run deamon on *every* other brick
      - sync a given file at most once every 10 minutes (?)
      -

- [x] (0:45?) (0:89) gluster: implement sync locking -- skip syncing a file if there is a file called .filename.gluster.lock
      at the destination, and it is at most 1 hour (?) old.


   Hmm. I just hit an interesting fact:

      - using bup with *fuse* (and only fuse!) to restore a sparse image locally via copy is fast and
        does result in a sparse image.  Whatever.

      - I can make efficient disaster recover backups as follows:

        (1) central OFFSITE-able:
          - use bup to backup to one place all the underlying qcow2 image that contains the brick.  a 256GB image locally would take
            about an hour and occupies the *same* space as reading string through the sparse image would use.
            And when the qcow2 image is not fully used, it takes proportionally less time.   Because it is qcow2 instead
            of sparse, we can recompress it, and extracting works well too, and would take about an hour in the above size.
            Also, the (asymptotic) speed is the same over the network, and things dedup very well, given the setting.
            This is awesome.

            We would do this for exactly *one* of the volumes (no need to do all three), since we can't do it for the google volumes.

            In fact, I should convert the cassandra images to qcow2 format and also start backing them up this way too,
            since it's the easiest possible safest way for recovery.   I could then likely backup everything to <1TB for
            quite some time.

        (2) use lvm snapshots on the LVM brick volumes, to provide an "undo" just in case. Obviously, an attacker could
            just reformat everything.  Hmm.

        mkdir -p /mnt/dc0-projects; mount -t glusterfs 10.1.1.5:/dc0-projects /mnt/dc0-projects
        mkdir -p /mnt/dc1-projects; mount -t glusterfs 10.1.1.5:/dc1-projects /mnt/dc1-projects
        mkdir -p /mnt/dc2-projects; mount -t glusterfs 10.1.1.5:/dc2-projects /mnt/dc2-projects
        /mnt/dc0-projects/salvus/project.py --verbose sync --watch /mnt/brick1/  /mnt/dc1-projects/ /mnt/dc2-projects/


 -- [ ] automate determining the sources and targets for sync, if not explicitly given, based on parsing the output of "gluster volume info" on the node, along with getting the ipaddress.  Then I'll be able to just run this on each node:

     /mnt/dc0-projects/salvus/project.py --verbose sync_daemons

This will in turn run (say):

    /mnt/dc0-projects/salvus/project.py --verbose sync --daemon --pidfile=brick1.pid --logfile=brick1.log /mnt/brick1 /mnt/dc1-projects/ /mnt/dc2-projects/
    /mnt/dc0-projects/salvus/project.py --verbose sync --daemon --pidfile=brick2.pid --logfile=brick2.log /mnt/brick2 /mnt/dc1-projects/ /mnt/dc2-projects/

and when the above is killed, it will kill these two.

So:

   - [x] (0:45?) (0:34) project: make daemon mode for sync watcher
   - [x] (0:30?) (0:25) storage: rewrite to use proper logging
-->   - [ ] (0:30?) storage: make it automatically figure out targets
   - [ ] (0:30?) storage: make it automatically figure out bricks and run their daemons



##

Then...

   Typical current location
      {"host":"10.1.11.4","username":"xdctYThX","port":22,"path":"."}
      {"host":"10.1.21.4","username":"bfa9ae97e9ff4978888940d082c84c49","port":22,"path":"."}

   HA gluster backwards compatible *enhancement*:

      {"gluster-zfs":true, 'datacenter':'padelford'}   # was last mounted at 10.1.11.4
      {"gluster-zfs":true, 'datacenter':'padelford', 'host':'10.1.11.4'}   # possibly mounted at 10.1.11.4 (but if hosts reboots this is false)


      - location=8 char username: behave as now

      - how to deploy:
          - look at projects/project_id path for each mounted gluster volume on the particular hub server.
          - take the one that is working, available, and has newest version


      - location=no username (but ip given): default the username to equal the project id with -'s removed.
      - location=none: lock, choose least-loaded vm in datacenter with newest available replica, run "project.py mount" there, set username
          wait -- add a last_location field in the database, so we know where the project was last successfully mounted.
      - what about project *creation*?


- [ ] (1:00?) ui -- button to stop a project, which unmounts it, etc..  This below "restart project server".
              don't have this for projects that have location=8 char username.


## Next

- [ ] important observation: the current cassandra driver I'm using does a TERRIBLE job dealing with database nodes not being accessible if they are given in the pool!  Watch out.

- [ ] idea for sharing project data with other projects -- use ZFS NFS support -- http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1448/gayne.html

- [ ] (1:30?) create a global gluster volume called "data"; the bricks could be zfs so we get compression and deduplication.
- [ ] (1:30?) create a global gluster volume called "scratch"
      note: can quota a directory even before it is created -- http://gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Setting_or_Replacing_Disk_Limit

- [ ] (1:00?) change so that *hub* closes project after a certain period, not projects themselves, and use project.py unmount
      To do this, we could simply scan the projects modified in the last week that were not modified in the last day, and ensure
      those are all closed.

- [ ] (2:00?) add UI, etc. to increase quota

- [ ] (2:00?) snapshots: switch to using ZFS for them.
      there's a debian package called "zfs-auto-snapshot".

- [ ] migrate all projects...




## Multi-data center HA
- [ ] (0:20?) get rid of existing glusterfs on bare metal
- [ ] (0:30?) change project.py script to create several ZFS img files that are 256MB each
- [ ] (0:45?) change project.py script when migrating to create several ZFS img files are a min of 1GB and a max of the size of the project (up to a limit)
- [ ] (2:00?) create a gluster service in admin.py which uses inotify to sync between clusters
- [ ] start building a debian image for GCE that's just my standard image (no lxc)



This will mount things as needed, start the gluster daemon, and also my inotify-based geo-sync daemons.  Also, the info in this config will be used by the compute vm's.

- [ ] modify compute vm to use global gluster store for projects
    - [ ] on startup the compute vm would mount glusterfs (given by some configuration info)
      (this would mean rooting a compute vm gives that person access to all projects unless I
       somehow encrypt them, but zfs doesn't do encryption: https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/494)
      But encrypting isn't supported, would likely kill the sparseness anyways.  Ugh.
      Solution: make it very, very easy for users to use encfs *inside* their projects if they elect to -- flip a switch.
      This solves a lot of problems.
    - [ ] to launch a project, hub will just connect in as "salvus" and run a sudo script that
      imports the relevant zfs pool, which will make /home/projectid mounted and available,
      possibly creating the relevant user and chown'ing.  Also, set database entry with location.
    - [ ] to stop a project, hub connect in, kill all projectid procs, then export the zfs pool.





## Other


- [ ] modify compute vm to use cgroups to limit users


- [ ] combine stunnel and haproxy: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/142ec7a3b987273c

- [ ] setup k-node glusterfs cluster at google us-central-1, and sync it with my existing glusterfs filesystem.  Use another filesystem instead of ext4 (?)

- [ ] geosync: implement locking system and randomized waiting, so I can run daemons on all nodes

- [ ] geosync: when copying, if it takes k seconds to copy a file, don't recopy it again for 2k seconds (?), so that a single file doesn't hog resources.

- [ ] design and implement a backup system for the global glusterfs data store, to recover from catastrophic point-in-time failure.
      Idea:
          - create a Linux VM with a large ZFS filesystem.
          - remotely mount it over nfs or just make it another glusterfs target
          - http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/GlusterOnZFS

- [ ] experiment with performance impact of disabling ZIL for zfs mounted projects: `zfs set sync=disabled sp1`

- [ ] lxc container project that can mount project and run it with a given ip address:  lxc container
     - a base image, which is easy to move forward
     - mounts the zfs /home/project directory
     - datasets volume (sync it somehow to other dc's when adding new data)


- [ ] write script that for each project, sets something in database ('temporary maintenance'),
      updates the image (via rsync), then sets a field in projects database that says that
      project has been migrated to LXC+glusterfs+ZFS.

- [ ] rewrite snapshot interface to use zfs snapshots instead of bup

- [ ] get LXC container system to also work with GCE

- [ ] when connection gets created for new_local_hub, it will always query database for location and use that.

- [ ] if new_local_hub queries and gets empty location, it will call function to deploy project, then make connection

- [ ] (2:00?) project should get location info it needs from database (or just move that to localhub).

- [ ] (1:00?) project move: better ui feedback on move

- [ ] (3:00?) once snapshots are under control, e.g., using zfs and user-deletable: tell Rupert Hölzl <r@hoelzl.fr>

         - cluster1 has a read/write glusterfs volume of projects it owns
         - cluster2 and cluster3 have geo-replicated versions of cluster1's projects in a *separate* store, for redundancy purposes
         - when cluster1 goes down or a user moves project to cluster2, *then* copy the project image from the
           geo-replicated slave to the cluster2 master volume and later remove it from the master on cluster1.
      Good idea?  Yes if:
           - geo-replication is actually efficient with sparse files
           - copying a sparse file is efficient.




- [ ] wild idea: have a slow distributed redundant "cloud filesystem" of newest version of all projects, which is distributed among all machines, with redundancy.  It is *only* used for project move and a "nearly live latest backup", but not run off of.  Active projects get rsync'd to it.  Either this exists already (in a form that doesn't completely suck), or I can write something that accomplishes the same thing, which is *organized* on top of cassandra (?).  Lay out the rules and try.

  - Researching this.  Looking at *gluster*.

It turns out that the above is really slow?!

// on a client vm:

root@compute1a:/mnt/projects# sync; dd bs=1M count=128 if=/dev/zero of=test conv=fdatasync; sync
128+0 records in
128+0 records out
134217728 bytes (134 MB) copied, 11.334 s, 11.8 MB/s
root@compute1a:/mnt/projects# time ls teaAuZ9M/>/dev/null
real    0m0.190s

That's exactly my network speed, given TINC.

On bare metal:

salvus@cloud1:~/vm/images/gluster$ sync; dd bs=1M count=128 if=/dev/zero of=test conv=fdatasync; sync
128+0 records in
128+0 records out
134217728 bytes (134 MB) copied, 2.00069 s, 67.1 MB/s



Try again, but with no encryption in simplest setup:

sudo gluster volume create testvol replica 2 transport tcp cloud1.math.washington.edu:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/testvol cloud2.math.washington.edu:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/testvol

sudo gluster volume create testvol replica 2 transport tcp 10.1.1.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/img 10.1.1.2:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/img

Extracting sage with a mounted client on a vm took this long:  11m43.856s

The dd test on the compute vm is FAST -- almost same as local disk: 134217728 bytes (134 MB) copied, 2.21882 s, 60.5 MB/s
So the time diff might be latency.


 * Info about using ssl encryption with glusterfs: http://nongnu.13855.n7.nabble.com/Glusterfs-SSL-capability-td168156.html
 * Make xfs .img loopback device: http://www.mail-archive.com/gluster-users@gluster.org/msg08360.html

Something to test:

   - create a loopback device on top of glusterfs: how does it perform?

   dd of=test.img seek=1024 bs=1M count=0
   losetup /dev/loop1 test.img
   losetup -a | grep loop1
   mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop1
   mount -o loop /dev/loop1 /mnt/test

Wow, this is *amazing* -- it completely solves the latency issue and provides exactly what I really need.

Problem: Do the above, but with a qcow2 image.

    modprobe nbd max_part=63
    qemu-img create -f qcow2 test.qcow2 10G

    qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 `pwd`/test.qcow2  # exact path is critical!
    fdisk /dev/nbd0
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/nbd0p1

    mount /dev/nbd0 /mnt/test2

Later

    qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0

This seems very slow and flakie.

### this works very nicely, and doesn't waste space.  GOOD.

    #dd if=/dev/zero of=sparse.img bs=1 count=0 seek=10G
    truncate -s 10G sparse.img
    losetup /dev/loop2 sparse.img

#### To re-sparsify

    time cp --sparse=always sparse.img sparse2.img


### Problem: Format sparse image using zfs -- try to compressed and de-duplicate

(best ZFS docs: https://pthree.org/2012/12/19/zfs-administration-part-xii-snapshots-and-clones/)

    apt-add-repository --yes ppa:zfs-native/stable
    apt-get update; apt-get install ubuntu-zfs  # takes a long time!

    truncate -s 10G sparse-zfs.img
    losetup /dev/loop1 sparse-zfs.img

    mkdir /mnt/testzfs
    zpool create -m /mnt/testzfs rpool /dev/loop1
    zfs set compression=gzip-9 rpool
    zfs set dedup=on rpool
    zfs get compressratio rpool; zpool get dedupratio rpool
    zfs set quota=5G rpool

    zfs snapshot rpool@s2

    zpool destroy rpool

Proposal:

   - (LATER!?) I create a big glusterfs like I did this morning, which is distributed across the tinc VPN, with
     say two copies of each file per datacenter (with 3 data centers: 4545, padelford, gce).

   - For each project, create a sparse zfs image file
               project-id.img
     setup as above with ZFS on it, and rsync in that project.
     The name of the pool will be the project id.


   - When a project runs somewhere, it mounts the project-id.img using a loopback device.
     (NOTE on loopback device limits -- http://old.slax.org/documentation_loop_mount.php)


### TEST

        truncate -s 128G 3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b.img
        losetup /dev/loop1 3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b.img
        mkdir /mnt/3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b
        zpool create -m /mnt/3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b  pool-3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b /dev/loop1
        zfs set compression=gzip pool-3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b
        zfs set dedup=on pool-3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b
        zfs set quota=4G pool-3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b
        zfs get compressratio pool-3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b; zpool get dedupratio pool-3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b


Wait, ZFS is too clever -- no need for loopback devices craziness!

    truncate -s 4G zfs-file.img
    cd /mnt/glusterfs/x/
    zpool create -m /mnt/test2 test `pwd`/zfs-file.img

    zpool set feature@lz4_compress=enabled test; zfs set compression=lz4 test
    zfs set dedup=on test
    zfs get compressratio test; zpool get dedupratio test

    zfs umount /mnt/test2
    zfs mount -a

    zpool export test

    zpool import test -d /mnt/glusterfs/x/

    # Add new images files to pool?  Yep.  So I can easily expand the available space for a project.  So no *need* to use zfs quota.
    truncate -s 4G zfs-file-2.img
    zpool add test /mnt/glusterfs/x/zfs-file-2.img
    # and instantly there is more space.  NICE.

Note -- if user deletes a lot of data off img, it does *NOT* get smaller.  However, when offline, one can try the following to shrink it, but it DOES NOT WORK:

    time cp --sparse=always 0.img 1.img

Another approach: add a new file, then remove the old one?  Nope.  Worry about this later, since there is always the obvious *and optimal* solution of just making a new img, since that goes through and recompresses and dedups everything...

    SUCKs.

    # this is very fast locally
    time cp -rv --sparse=always projects/* /mnt/projects/

    # So, if I can somehow mount -- say via nfs and a tunnel or something !? -- the glusterfs volume, then we can probably do it fine.



- [ ] convert some of the 18262 projects (maybe the 2356 on compute1a?) to img files in the following format, with the user having uid/gid 1001

        glusterfs volume "projects"
            projects/
                project-id/
                   0.img
                   ...  # reserved for "other stuff" -- not sure what -- later
                project-id/
                   ..

      - [ ] write python script that automates making the project-id image thing above.

                 project2zfs.py  /mnt/home/foo  /path/to/projects/

          - [x] first version: assumes /path/to/projects/project-id doesn't exist; makes it, copies over files, sets uid and gid
          - [x] next version: if /path/to/projects/project-id exists, mounts it, then rsync updates
          - [x] version that works on multiple input paths

- [x] (0:37) write script project_storage.py subcommand that uses db and goes through and adds the info.json files to *all* project home on a given vm, if they aren't there already.

- [x] run above conversion script on all projects.


- [ ] when things look good, figure out how to make this global.

   - OPTION 1 -- global glusterfs:
     create glusterfs with 1 replicas in each DC and 12 bricks in each of these data centers (so replication factor=3)

           padelford              1   2   3   4   5   6   7  1b  2b  3b  4b  5b
           4545                  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21
           gce-us-central-1     u1a u2a u1b u2b u1c u2c u1d u2d u1e u2e u1f g2f

         ##  gce-europe           e1a e2a e1b e2b e1c e2c e1d e2d e1e e2e e1f e2f   <--- too slow (?)

        I wonder -- will this make filesystem way slower (?) -- if so, we have a major problem with the whole design,
        and would have to pivot yet again :-(.

        Let's do a test:

            sudo gluster volume create projects0 replica 2 transport tcp 10.1.1.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects0 10.1.10.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects0

            sudo gluster volume set projects0 auth.allow 10.1.*

            That works *fine*.

   - OPTION 2 -- glusterfs inside each DC

     - create one glusterfs with no encryption/vpn inside each datacenter; replication factor = 2 (?)

     - write something to sync securely over the internet via rsync, where we sync back and forth with the newest file winning.  Since the files are these images, there is just one file, and conflict resolution is super easy.

Try this out right now on cloud3, cloud4:

sudo gluster volume create projects replica 2 transport tcp cloud3:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud4:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/

    OK, this is dramatically better.  Super, super good.  Wow.  WOW!


So here's the plan:

        - setup a non-encrypted replication factor=2 glusterfs in each data center, *including* tower.
          (worry about firewall and auth guest restriction.)

3,4,5,6,7
10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21

    # For each, do
    sudo gluster volume set projects auth.allow '192.168.*'

        - start copy over project data from guests to their own centers...


        - also work on how to merge it all together across data centers regularly and automatically using a sync system; maybe csync2, or maybe just rsync with the -u option:
                -u, --update                skip files that are newer on the receiver

          Annoying issue: rsync of a sparse file is dog slow (?)
            # on cloud1
            time rsync -axvHu --sparse /mnt/projects/ cloud3:/mnt/projects/

          See this about inplace and sparse -- http://gergap.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/rsync-and-sparse-files/

          when done, the 3-7 and 10-21 DC's will have the union of all images.

        - mount and run images using an lxc container + dynamic vpn network.


read/write test:

Eliminating SPOF on mount: http://www.jamescoyle.net/how-to/439-mount-a-glusterfs-volume


---

PLAN:

 - glusterfs data and scratch volumes, which are shared across the system -- convenient for users.
 - have a large glusterfs volume with replication of (at least 2, for now) where canonical version of projects are stored, and project is periodically rsync'd back when running.

     Testing this: it takes hours (?) just to rsync my 2.5GB devel project over.  Thus to see if this is a usable approach, I will need to try various optimizations.  The big issue is encryption, probably.

     Idea: - completely unencrypted in data center
           - client vm connects to host only to mount (not over vpn)
           - use an ssh tunnel *between* data centers, where encryption is required


     Idea: - completely unencrypted in data center
           - client vm connects to host only to mount (not over vpn)
           - use an ssh tunnel *between* data centers, where encryption is required


 - when user opens or moves a project, if not deployed, it gets rsync from glusterfs volume as first choice.
 -




   - [ ] (1:00?) (0:20?) project move: *all* hubs using that project need to react to project move correctly... argh.  This is hard because there is no inter-hub message system... and I don't want one if I can avoid it!

  - If the project is working, then it can broadcast that it is going to be moved to all connected hubs, and they can take appropriate action.
  - If the project is not working, e.g., because the machine it is deployed on is down, then there are no connected hubs.

... so it seems like all I need is a way for a local hub to tell all connected global hubs to close *all* connections to it.
OR, even more simply, when a global hub looses the connection to the local hub, it checks in the database that the location
is the same before trying to reconnect.

So I just need to modify Project and LocalHub so that instead of caching the VM they are connected to, whenever they need that information they get it fresh from the database.  Then everything else takes care of itself.

---->  - [x] (1:30) new_local_hub should *only* take project_id as input and only cached based on that.

       - [ ] be sure to test this codepath in hub.coffee: "This deals with VERY RARE case where user of project somehow deleted"
       - [x] test this killall change: "pkill -9 -u `whoami`"


[x] CRAZY idea:  NO!
    Just have one massive gluster across the world, which is "dog slow".
    However, when actually *using* images, just copy them out of gluster
    to the local disk, and every time they change copy back, letting that
    take as long as it takes.   This would basically solve all problems,
    except it would mean that opening a projct not in the local "cache"
    takes longer.  That is acceptable.

    This would be *very* easy to implement.  Also, I could totally consider using
    cassandra for this.... but that would require tar'ing every time, which is not realistic.

    Test mounting a zpool locally inside vm and extracting sage tarball:

        truncate -s 2G test.img
        zpool create test -d /tmp/test.img
        time wget http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-5.13.rc0/sage-5.13.rc0-boxen-x86_64-Linux.tar.gz
        # about 35 seconds
        zfs set compression=gzip test
        zfs set dedup=on test

    This is stupid.  It just throws away valuable information, and isn't much faster.  It also guarantees we'll loose
    data when things go wrong.

# LXC -- attempted to combine all services into a single LXC machine with projects running in containers

...and it fails for small subtle reasons, e.g., problems with GCE, lack of support for key features in ZFS, too much change to the overall system

This makes me want a replication factor of 3 for gluster instead of 2, because when one nodes down, then suddenly
there is a single point of failure.
I also wonder if I should virtualize the gluster nodes even on cloud-n?
Pros:
   - very easily use a different filesystem (e.g., xfs or even zfs)
   - physically move them
   - reduce attack surface
   - use ubuntu 13.10 instead of 12.04
   - simplify selling the private version
Cons:
   - slower

I'm also thinking of making it so the ZFS raw image files are smaller, which makes geo-sync potentially more efficient.

I could:

  - configure a single ubuntu 13.10 VM:
      - tinc vpn
      - runs gluster (with replication=3)
      - runs cassandra (with replication=3)
      - runs nginx
      - runs haproxy
      - runs stunnel
      - runs some hubs in containers
      - runs projects in containers

  - move my entire existing system into the above, so I'm just running such identical vm's everywhere.

     - [x] setup a container that will be used for running hubs, nginx, haproxy, stunnel:
              time sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n salvus -- -b salvus

     - [x] setup a container that will be used for running projects:
              sudo adduser project # should be user 1001 on host!; use a large random password
              time sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n project -- -b project

             also setup external crontab bup of the vm images to another directory on same machine, and another less frequent
             bup of the images to cloud11 (from cloud10).  This is a lot of backups, but I think there is a high probability of
             messing up bigtime while doing the rest of the steps to get this new system up and running, and I feel error prone.

# Next release (base vm update)
  - [x] raise the simultaneous ssh connection limit to 50
  - [ x] pip install pyinotify



# Reboot -- how about just map zpool's to user home directories, and run a chown when necessary?

        mkdir -p /mnt/projects; mount -t glusterfs 10.1.14.5:/projects /mnt/projects

        Thus make it so projects can be mounted from the projects pool, using zfs, and username=projectid

   mount -o bind,uid=1892,gid=1892 /mnt/projects/c1f1dc4a-dbf0-4fc6-9878-012020a0a829/ /mnt/home/DU6rFFKG/
   zfs allow -s @adminrole snapshot project-c1f1dc4a-dbf0-4fc6-9878-012020a0a829

- [x] (1:44) project.py -- make 0.img that is max of (1.5*current, 256MB); project.py -- *mount* the ZFS image at /home/projectid and create the account called "projectid"; chown.

- [x] (0:45?) (0:37) project.py -- can be called repeatedly without trouble and has useful exit codes.

- [x] install standard packages on a GCE node.

  - [x] define data centers:
      dc0 = 4545 data center
      dc1 = padelford
      dc2 = gce uc-central-1



  - [x] redo the bricks on my machines: gluster1-21 to each be 256GB, with 2 bricks only on gluster1.
  - [x] create two more gce gluster nodes: 10.3.3.5, 10.3.4.5
  - [x] create gce web node: will be used for developing other stuff below.
  - [x] create a compute node
  - [x] create two cassandra nodes with 128GB/each
  - [x] push all gce tinc keys to all cloud-n nodes.
  - [x] make a single massive gluster *cluster*:

### web1gce1

 - [x] start stunnel/haproxy/nginx/hub running on 10.3.1.3=web1gce1=108.59.84.126 but using same database, etc.



- [x] get rid of the old glusterfs on hosts

- [x] quick global *test* volume

   gluster volume create global-share replica 3 transport tcp 10.1.1.5:/tmp/global  10.1.10.5:/tmp/global 10.3.1.5:/tmp/global
   gluster volume start global-share
   mkdir -p /mnt/global-share; mount -t glusterfs 10.1.1.5:/global-share /mnt/global-share/

   12 seconds to simply read a little file!  Ugh.  Useless.
