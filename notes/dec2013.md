# Next release (base vm update)

  - [ ] raise the simultaneous ssh connection limit to 50

# Top priority GOALS

- [ ] decommission cloud13:
   - [ ] compute13a:
         # The following would take 7 hours... -- too slow!
         rsync -axvH --sparse cassandra13-cassandra.img compute13a-home.img cloud14:tmp/

         # Fortunately, I've been obsessed with how to transfer sparse files lately.  Try this instead
         # (takes about 40 minutes to make, then 40 to transfer)
         time bsdtar cvf sparse.tar compute13a-home.img
   - [x] remove compute13a from database compute servers table:
           select * from compute_servers where dummy=true;
           DELETE from compute_servers where dummy=true and host='10.1.13.4';
   - [ ] move cassandra13
   - [ ] what about web13 (huge!) -- just don't bother
   - [ ] disable in dns: https://dns.godaddy.com/ZoneFile.aspx?zone=SAGEMATHCLOUD.COM&zoneType=0&sa=isc%3dbb1455jd90&refer=dcc&marketID=en-US
   - [ ] a glusterfs is running on cloud13 -- how to remove it and rebalance data -- good to learn this now.
        # This *might* be helpful -- there's 36GB of data.
        root@cloud13:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster# time bsdtar cf /tmp/projects-cloud13.tar projects
        I could then do this: http://gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Migrating_Volumes

I kind of want replication factor of 3 for gluster instead of 2, because when one nodes down, then suddenly
there is a single point of failure.
I also wonder if I should virtualize the gluster nodes even on cloud-n?
Pros:
   - very easily use a different filesystem (e.g., xfs or even zfs)
   - physically move them
   - reduce attack surface
   - use ubuntu 13.10 instead of 12.04
   - simplify selling the private version
Cons:
   - slower

I'm also thinking of making it so the ZFS raw image files are smaller, which makes geo-sync potentially more efficient.

I could:

  - configure a single ubuntu 13.10 VM:
      - tinc vpn
      - runs gluster (with replication=3)
      - runs cassandra (with replication=3)
      - runs nginx
      - runs haproxy
      - runs stunnel
      - runs some hubs in containers
      - runs projects in containers

  - move my entire existing system into the above, so I'm just running such identical vm's everywhere.

--> - [ ] create brand new ubuntu 13.10 machine on cloud10

        qemu-img create -f qcow2 base.img 64G        # ext4  -- the base vm linux install
        qemu-img create -f qcow2 lxc.img 128G        # btrfs -- /var/lib/lxc: for lxc containers
        qemu-img create -f qcow2 gluster-0.img 256G  # xfs gluster brick0 -- we'll grow these as needed

        virt-install --connect qemu:///system --cpu host --network user,model=virtio --name smc --vcpus=8 --ram 8192 --cdrom ~/vm/images/iso/ubuntu-13.10-server-amd64.iso --disk ~/vm/images/smc/base.img,device=disk,bus=virtio,format=qcow2,cache=writeback --disk ~/vm/images/smc/lxc.img,device=disk,bus=virtio,format=qcow2,cache=writeback --disk ~/vm/images/smc/gluster-0.img,device=disk,bus=virtio,format=qcow2,cache=writeback --graphics vnc,port=12102

        virsh autostart  # see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/libvirt

        ssh -L 12102:localhost:12102 salvus@cloud1.math.washington.edu

     - [x] install base os and update/upgrade
     - [x] put on the tinc vpn as 10.1.10.5 (for now)
     - [x] disable the graphical console on the virtual machine (security risk) -- "virsh edit smc"
     - [ ] install lxc
     - [ ] setup /var/lib/lxc filesystem (btrfs)
     - [ ] setup /gluster/0/  brick (and format xfs)
     - [ ] install gluster
     - [ ] install lxc ubuntu image
     - [ ] install git and salvus repo in ~/salvus
     - [ ] test lxc container system working
     - [ ] setup gluster fs

- [ ] setup k-node glusterfs cluster at google us-central-1, and sync it with my existing glusterfs filesystem.  Use another filesystem instead of ext4 (?)

- [ ] geosync: implement locking system and randomized waiting, so I can run daemons on all nodes

- [ ] geosync: when copying, if it takes k seconds to copy a file, don't recopy it again for 2k seconds (?), so that a single file doesn't hog resources.

- [ ] design and implement a backup system for the global glusterfs data store, to recover from catastrophic point-in-time failure.
      Idea:
          - create a Linux VM with a large ZFS filesystem.
          - remotely mount it over nfs or just make it another glusterfs target
          - http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/GlusterOnZFS

- [ ] experiment with performance impact of disabling ZIL for zfs mounted projects: `zfs set sync=disabled sp1`

- [ ] lxc container project that can mount project and run it with a given ip address:  lxc container
     - a base image, which is easy to move forward
     - mounts the zfs /home/project directory
     - datasets volume (sync it somehow to other dc's when adding new data)


- [ ] write script that for each project, sets something in database ('temporary maintenance'),
      updates the image (via rsync), then sets a field in projects database that says that
      project has been migrated to LXC+glusterfs+ZFS.

- [ ] rewrite snapshot interface to use zfs snapshots instead of bup

- [ ] get LXC container system to also work with GCE

- [ ] when connection gets created for new_local_hub, it will always query database for location and use that.

- [ ] if new_local_hub queries and gets empty location, it will call function to deploy project, then make connection

- [ ] (2:00?) project should get location info it needs from database (or just move that to localhub).

- [ ] (1:00?) project move: better ui feedback on move

- [ ] (3:00?) once snapshots are under control, e.g., using zfs and user-deletable: tell Rupert Hölzl <r@hoelzl.fr>

    Total cost: about $1200/month

    - [ ] (0:30?) Add the public web server ip's to godaddy dns.

========================

- [x] (1:30?) (0:58+) bup snapshotting issue when sshfs is stale.
   ',3702601d-9fbc-4e4e-b7ab-c10a79e34d3b,command '/usr/bin/bup' (args=on teaAuZ9M@10.1.2.4 index --one-file-system .) exited with nonzero code 1 -- stderr='/mnt/home/teaAuZ9M/lxc: [Errno 107] Transport endpoint is not connected: 'lxc'

   Should be fixed -- wait 15 minutes to see if cloud.dev project gets snapshotted; if so, good!
   If so, update bup on all compute machines.


- [x] (0:15?) enable crontabs on 10.9.1.2, once the two backups finished.

- [x] (1:00?) (0:40) change the create_unix_user.py (sudo) command to optionally take an account name as input.
- [x] (1:00?) (0:18) fix json worksheet printing issue that Harald pointed out with his theano example; also "tmp/linear regression.sagews" -- worksheet that doesn't print from Gustav Delius

- [x] (0:30?) (0:09) worksheet printing -- command line option to leave files around.

- [x] (1:00?) FAIL to add file attachment to worksheet printing -- http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/94811/attaching-file-into-a-pdf-with-pdflatex-will-crash-adobe-reader

- [x] (0:10?) (0:09) send updated "file usage" data.

- [x] (0:45?) (0:47) snap -- save last successful snapshot in own table (make sure snap user doesn't have to edit project table).

    CREATE TABLE last_snapshot (
        project_id uuid,
        server_id  uuid,
        repo_id    uuid,
        timestamp  varchar,
        utc_seconds_epoch int,
        PRIMARY KEY(project_id, server_id)
    );


- [x] (1:00?) (2:00) show most recent available snapshot time, with a link to the snapshots listings.
- [x] (0:30?) last snapshot -- doesn't update properly -- why?!

- [x] (1:00?) (0:30) change smc favicon to be sage in color... and/or maybe use harald's?: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/142aead2719273d3

- [x] (1:00?) (1:08) project move: change username to project-id on project move and also new project creation; this is more logical and avoids all possible issues of conflict in future, especially enabling having a hot standby.f
- [x] (2:00?) (0:37) project move: go through each snapshot until success.
- [x] this repo on 10.1.10.3 is broken:
        202630a1-b0a5-422f-8e4f-b48e4998b371
    echo "select timestamp, project_id from snap_commits where repo_id=202630a1-b0a5-422f-8e4f-b48e4998b371; " | cqlsh_connect 10.1.3.2 |sort> a
    I had to go back 14 commits with snap_fix... script!?



   - [x] apt-get autoremove; apt-get clean
   - [x] install gluster 3.4.1: http://download.gluster.org/pub/gluster/glusterfs/3.4/3.4.1/Ubuntu/Ubuntu.README
          add-apt-repository ppa:semiosis/ubuntu-glusterfs-3.4
          apt-get update
          apt-get install glusterfs-client
   - [x] zfs support
          apt-add-repository --yes ppa:zfs-native/stable
          apt-get update
          time apt-get install ubuntu-zfs  # takes a long time - 12 minutes (?)
   - [x] update salvus repo
   - [x] update system-wide bup from git repo.
   - [x] update create_unix_user.py
   - [x] standard upgrades



- [x] copy /etc/hosts over from cloud1
- [x] apt-get install nfs-client
- [x] try out glusterfs geo-replication.  I could do the following (?):
         - cluster1 has a read/write glusterfs volume of projects it owns
         - cluster2 and cluster3 have geo-replicated versions of cluster1's projects in a *separate* store, for redundancy purposes
         - when cluster1 goes down or a user moves project to cluster2, *then* copy the project image from the
           geo-replicated slave to the cluster2 master volume and later remove it from the master on cluster1.
      Good idea?  Yes if:
           - geo-replication is actually efficient with sparse files
           - copying a sparse file is efficient.




- [ ] wild idea: have a slow distributed redundant "cloud filesystem" of newest version of all projects, which is distributed among all machines, with redundancy.  It is *only* used for project move and a "nearly live latest backup", but not run off of.  Active projects get rsync'd to it.  Either this exists already (in a form that doesn't completely suck), or I can write something that accomplishes the same thing, which is *organized* on top of cassandra (?).  Lay out the rules and try.

  - Researching this.  Looking at *gluster*.

  sudo apt-get install glusterfs-server
  sudo gluster peer probe cloud2.math.washington.edu
  sudo gluster peer probe cloud1.math.washington.edu  # on cloud2
  sudo gluster volume create testvol replica 2 transport tcp cloud1.math.washington.edu:/tmp/data cloud2.math.washington.edu:/tmp/data
  sudo mkdir /mnt/glusterfs  # on both machines
  mount -t glusterfs cloud1.math.washington.edu:/testvol /mnt/glusterfs
  How to setup so that each datacenter has two copies of files: http://gluster.org/pipermail/gluster-users/2011-March/029810.html

- [ ] make a big peer network of all my host vm's using /home/salvus/vm/images/gluster

        sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.2.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.3.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.4.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.5.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.6.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.7.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.10.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.11.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.12.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.13.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.14.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.15.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.16.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.17.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.18.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.19.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.20.1; sudo gluster peer probe 10.1.21

### Projects

' '.join(['10.1.%i.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects'%i for i in [1,10,  2,11,  3,12,  4,13,  5,14,  6,15,  7,16]])

        sudo gluster volume create projects replica 2 transport tcp 10.1.1.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.10.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.2.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.11.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.3.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.12.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.4.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.13.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.5.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.14.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.6.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.15.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.7.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects 10.1.16.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects

        sudo gluster volume set projects auth.allow 10.*

It turns out that the above is really slow?!

// on a client vm:

root@compute1a:/mnt/projects# sync; dd bs=1M count=128 if=/dev/zero of=test conv=fdatasync; sync
128+0 records in
128+0 records out
134217728 bytes (134 MB) copied, 11.334 s, 11.8 MB/s
root@compute1a:/mnt/projects# time ls teaAuZ9M/>/dev/null
real    0m0.190s

That's exactly my network speed, given TINC.

On bare metal:

salvus@cloud1:~/vm/images/gluster$ sync; dd bs=1M count=128 if=/dev/zero of=test conv=fdatasync; sync
128+0 records in
128+0 records out
134217728 bytes (134 MB) copied, 2.00069 s, 67.1 MB/s



Try again, but with no encryption in simplest setup:

sudo gluster volume create testvol replica 2 transport tcp cloud1.math.washington.edu:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/testvol cloud2.math.washington.edu:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/testvol

sudo gluster volume create testvol replica 2 transport tcp 10.1.1.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/img 10.1.1.2:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/img

Extracting sage with a mounted client on a vm took this long:  11m43.856s

The dd test on the compute vm is FAST -- almost same as local disk: 134217728 bytes (134 MB) copied, 2.21882 s, 60.5 MB/s
So the time diff might be latency.


 * Info about using ssl encryption with glusterfs: http://nongnu.13855.n7.nabble.com/Glusterfs-SSL-capability-td168156.html
 * Make xfs .img loopback device: http://www.mail-archive.com/gluster-users@gluster.org/msg08360.html

Something to test:

   - create a loopback device on top of glusterfs: how does it perform?

   dd of=test.img seek=1024 bs=1M count=0
   losetup /dev/loop1 test.img
   losetup -a | grep loop1
   mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop1
   mount -o loop /dev/loop1 /mnt/test

Wow, this is *amazing* -- it completely solves the latency issue and provides exactly what I really need.

Problem: Do the above, but with a qcow2 image.

    modprobe nbd max_part=63
    qemu-img create -f qcow2 test.qcow2 10G

    qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 `pwd`/test.qcow2  # exact path is critical!
    fdisk /dev/nbd0
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/nbd0p1

    mount /dev/nbd0 /mnt/test2

Later

    qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0

This seems very slow and flakie.

### this works very nicely, and doesn't waste space.  GOOD.

    #dd if=/dev/zero of=sparse.img bs=1 count=0 seek=10G
    truncate -s 10G sparse.img
    losetup /dev/loop2 sparse.img

#### To re-sparsify

    time cp --sparse=always sparse.img sparse2.img


### Problem: Format sparse image using zfs -- try to compressed and de-duplicate

(best ZFS docs: https://pthree.org/2012/12/19/zfs-administration-part-xii-snapshots-and-clones/)

    apt-add-repository --yes ppa:zfs-native/stable
    apt-get update; apt-get install ubuntu-zfs  # takes a long time!

    truncate -s 10G sparse-zfs.img
    losetup /dev/loop1 sparse-zfs.img

    mkdir /mnt/testzfs
    zpool create -m /mnt/testzfs rpool /dev/loop1
    zfs set compression=gzip-9 rpool
    zfs set dedup=on rpool
    zfs get compressratio rpool; zpool get dedupratio rpool
    zfs set quota=5G rpool

    zfs snapshot rpool@s2

    zpool destroy rpool

Proposal:

   - (LATER!?) I create a big glusterfs like I did this morning, which is distributed across the tinc VPN, with
     say two copies of each file per datacenter (with 3 data centers: 4545, padelford, gce).

   - For each project, create a sparse zfs image file
               project-id.img
     setup as above with ZFS on it, and rsync in that project.
     The name of the pool will be the project id.


   - When a project runs somewhere, it mounts the project-id.img using a loopback device.
     (NOTE on loopback device limits -- http://old.slax.org/documentation_loop_mount.php)

Wait, ZFS is too clever -- no need for loopback devices craziness!

    truncate -s 4G zfs-file.img
    cd /mnt/glusterfs/x/
    zpool create -m /mnt/test2 test `pwd`/zfs-file.img

    zpool set feature@lz4_compress=enabled test; zfs set compression=lz4 test
    zfs set dedup=on test
    zfs get compressratio test; zpool get dedupratio test

    zfs umount /mnt/test2
    zfs mount -a

    zpool export test

    zpool import test -d /mnt/glusterfs/x/

    # Add new images files to pool?  Yep.  So I can easily expand the available space for a project.  So no *need* to use zfs quota.
    truncate -s 4G zfs-file-2.img
    zpool add test /mnt/glusterfs/x/zfs-file-2.img
    # and instantly there is more space.  NICE.

Note -- if user deletes a lot of data off img, it does *NOT* get smaller.  However, when offline, one can try the following to shrink it, but it DOES NOT WORK:

    time cp --sparse=always 0.img 1.img

Another approach: add a new file, then remove the old one?  Nope.  Worry about this later, since there is always the obvious *and optimal* solution of just making a new img, since that goes through and recompresses and dedups everything...

    SUCKs.

    # this is very fast locally
    time cp -rv --sparse=always projects/* /mnt/projects/

    # So, if I can somehow mount -- say via nfs and a tunnel or something !? -- the glusterfs volume, then we can probably do it fine.



- [ ] convert some of the 18262 projects (maybe the 2356 on compute1a?) to img files in the following format, with the user having uid/gid 1001

        glusterfs volume "projects"
            projects/
                project-id/
                   0.img
                   ...  # reserved for "other stuff" -- not sure what -- later
                project-id/
                   ..

      - [ ] write python script that automates making the project-id image thing above.

                 project2zfs.py  /mnt/home/foo  /path/to/projects/

          - [x] first version: assumes /path/to/projects/project-id doesn't exist; makes it, copies over files, sets uid and gid
          - [x] next version: if /path/to/projects/project-id exists, mounts it, then rsync updates
          - [x] version that works on multiple input paths

- [x] (0:37) write script project_storage.py subcommand that uses db and goes through and adds the info.json files to *all* project home on a given vm, if they aren't there already.

- [x] run above conversion script on all projects.


- [ ] when things look good, figure out how to make this global.

   - OPTION 1 -- global glusterfs:
     create glusterfs with 1 replicas in each DC and 12 bricks in each of these data centers (so replication factor=3)

           padelford              1   2   3   4   5   6   7  1b  2b  3b  4b  5b

           gce-us-central-1     u1a u2a u1b u2b u1c u2c u1d u2d u1e u2e u1f g2f

         ##  gce-europe           e1a e2a e1b e2b e1c e2c e1d e2d e1e e2e e1f e2f   <--- too slow (?)

        I wonder -- will this make filesystem way slower (?) -- if so, we have a major problem with the whole design,
        and would have to pivot yet again :-(.

        Let's do a test:

            sudo gluster volume create projects0 replica 2 transport tcp 10.1.1.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects0 10.1.10.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects0

            sudo gluster volume set projects0 auth.allow 10.1.*

            That works *fine*.

   - OPTION 2 -- glusterfs inside each DC

     - create one glusterfs with no encryption/vpn inside each datacenter; replication factor = 2 (?)

     - write something to sync securely over the internet via rsync, where we sync back and forth with the newest file winning.  Since the files are these images, there is just one file, and conflict resolution is super easy.

Try this out right now on cloud3, cloud4:

sudo gluster volume create projects replica 2 transport tcp cloud3:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud4:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/

    OK, this is dramatically better.  Super, super good.  Wow.  WOW!


So here's the plan:

        - setup a non-encrypted replication factor=2 glusterfs in each data center, *including* tower.
          (worry about firewall and auth guest restriction.)

1,2
3,4,5,6,7
10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21

Do it:


        # on cloud1
        gluster peer probe cloud2
        gluster volume create projects replica 2 transport tcp cloud1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud2:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/

        # on cloud3
        gluster peer probe cloud4; gluster peer probe cloud5; gluster peer probe cloud6; gluster peer probe cloud7

        gluster volume create projects replica 2 transport tcp cloud3:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud4:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud5:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud6:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud7:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud3:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects1/

        gluster volume create projects replica 2 transport tcp 10.1.3.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ 10.1.4.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ 10.1.5.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ 10.1.6.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ 10.1.7.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ 10.1.3.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects1/

        # cloud10
        gluster peer probe cloud11;gluster peer probe cloud12;gluster peer probe cloud13;gluster peer probe cloud14;gluster peer probe cloud15;gluster peer probe cloud16;gluster peer probe cloud17;gluster peer probe cloud18;gluster peer probe cloud19;gluster peer probe cloud20;gluster peer probe cloud21

        gluster volume create projects replica 2 transport tcp cloud10:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud11:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud12:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud13:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud14:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud15:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud16:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud17:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud18:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud19:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud20:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ cloud21:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/


    # For each, do
    sudo gluster volume set projects auth.allow '192.168.*'

        - start copy over project data from guests to their own centers...


        - also work on how to merge it all together across data centers regularly and automatically using a sync system; maybe csync2, or maybe just rsync with the -u option:
                -u, --update                skip files that are newer on the receiver

          Annoying issue: rsync of a sparse file is dog slow (?)
            # on cloud1
            time rsync -axvHu --sparse /mnt/projects/ cloud3:/mnt/projects/

          See this about inplace and sparse -- http://gergap.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/rsync-and-sparse-files/

          when done, the 3-7 and 10-21 DC's will have the union of all images.

        - mount and run images using an lxc container + dynamic vpn network.


read/write test:

    root@cloud3:/mnt/projects# dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=512k count=1000
    root@cloud3:/mnt/projects# dd if=test of=/dev/null bs=512k count=1000

- [ ] setup new gluster cluster on cloud10, 11, 12 in VPN.

gluster volume create projects replica 4 transport tcp 10.1.10.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ 10.1.11.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ 10.1.12.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/ 10.1.13.1:/home/salvus/vm/images/gluster/projects/

    - test speed (both between nodes and with client):
             dd writes at about 20MB/s between hosts.
             sparse support sucks -- but good in ubuntu13.10 locally ?!
             client gets about 10-15MB/s


 sudo gluster volume create projects transport tcp 10.1.1.5:/gluster/test

    - test security (that isn't listening to outside connections)

Eliminating SPOF on mount: http://www.jamescoyle.net/how-to/439-mount-a-glusterfs-volume


---

PLAN:

 - glusterfs data and scratch volumes, which are shared across the system -- convenient for users.
 - have a large glusterfs volume with replication of (at least 2, for now) where canonical version of projects are stored, and project is periodically rsync'd back when running.

     Testing this: it takes hours (?) just to rsync my 2.5GB devel project over.  Thus to see if this is a usable approach, I will need to try various optimizations.  The big issue is encryption, probably.

     Idea: - completely unencrypted in data center
           - client vm connects to host only to mount (not over vpn)
           - use an ssh tunnel *between* data centers, where encryption is required


     Idea: - completely unencrypted in data center
           - client vm connects to host only to mount (not over vpn)
           - use an ssh tunnel *between* data centers, where encryption is required


 - when user opens or moves a project, if not deployed, it gets rsync from glusterfs volume as first choice.
 -




   - [ ] (1:00?) (0:20?) project move: *all* hubs using that project need to react to project move correctly... argh.  This is hard because there is no inter-hub message system... and I don't want one if I can avoid it!

  - If the project is working, then it can broadcast that it is going to be moved to all connected hubs, and they can take appropriate action.
  - If the project is not working, e.g., because the machine it is deployed on is down, then there are no connected hubs.

... so it seems like all I need is a way for a local hub to tell all connected global hubs to close *all* connections to it.
OR, even more simply, when a global hub looses the connection to the local hub, it checks in the database that the location
is the same before trying to reconnect.

So I just need to modify Project and LocalHub so that instead of caching the VM they are connected to, whenever they need that information they get it fresh from the database.  Then everything else takes care of itself.

---->  - [x] (1:30) new_local_hub should *only* take project_id as input and only cached based on that.

       - [ ] be sure to test this codepath in hub.coffee: "This deals with VERY RARE case where user of project somehow deleted"
       - [x] test this killall change: "pkill -9 -u `whoami`"
