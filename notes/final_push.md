# Implement project snapshot, restore, browse, stored in the database.


[x] (0:30?) (1:30)[slow due to distractions] learn about cassandra list type and about git files, etc.; not going to use cassandra lists for the actual blobs, etc., since they are for a different problem, and get read completely.

[x] (1:00?) (1:30)[distractions] determine exactly what files need to be stored in the database

   - all the actual pack/idx files
   - the value in "refs/heads/project"      (this is a file with a hash in it)

   Optimizations (bup automatically recreates all these files, so storing them in the db is probably a waste of space).
       - store all objects/pack/*midx* files
       - objects/pack/bup.bloom
       - various index cache files

   I just tried this branch:
     git clone https://github.com/zoranzaric/bup.git -b locked-repack locked-repack-2

   and it provides a "bup repack" command.  When run it replaces *all* the idx/pack files, no matter how many,
   by exactly two files.  I *might* need to use this when the number of snapshots for a given project gets very
   large, hence extracting it to the local filesystem would involving pulling thousands of tiny files from
   cassandra, etc., which would be very inefficient.  With bup repack, I would run it, create two new idx/pack
   pairs, save them to the DB, then change the project meta-info, and delete all the other idx/pack files
   associated to that project.

[x] (1:00?) add functionality to cassaandra.coffee to support what is needed (if necessary) -- nothing needed

Schema:


CREATE TABLE project_bups (
     project_id  uuid,
     time        timestamp,     /* when inserted */
     sha1        varchar,       /* sha1 hash of pack file */
     pack        blob,          /* contents of pack file */
     idx         blob,          /* index into this pack file */
     head        varchar,       /* head, when this pack file was the newest */
     PRIMARY KEY(project_id, time)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (time ASC);


UPDATE project_bups set sha1='7c814e1daea739e910693ff65d5046bf724ff807', head='7c814e1daea739e910693ff65d5046bf724ff807' where project_id=6a63fd69-c1c7-4960-9299-54cb96523966 and time=9390823493;
UPDATE project_bups set sha1='7c814e1daea739e910693ff65d5046bf724ff817', head='7c814e1daea739e910693ff65d5046bf724ff817' where project_id=6a63fd69-c1c7-4960-9299-54cb96523966 and time=9390823500;
UPDATE project_bups set sha1='7c814e1daea739e910693ff65d5046bf724ff810', head='7c814e1daea739e910693ff65d5046bf724ff810' where project_id=6a63fd69-c1c7-4960-9299-54cb96523966 and time=9390823400;

Works:

cqlsh:test> select * from project_bups where project_id=6a63fd69-c1c7-4960-9299-54cb96523966;
[x] (0:30?) create a table (in db_schema) with one row for each project backup, or add to the existing project schema (not sure which is best).


### the code below will just go in a new section of backup.coffee.

[ ] (1:00?) pull
     INPUT: project_id, path
     EFFECT:
         - fuse unmount if needed
         - pulls what is needed to update bup archive in path to current version in database
         - fuse mount

[ ] (1:00?) snapshot
     INPUT: project_id, path
     EFFECT:
        - does above update to path
        - makes a new snapshot of remote project (wherever it is) -- save everything except .sagemathcloud and .sage/gap and .forever
        - if there were actual changes (!), writes them to db (worry about timeouts/size); make sure last
          change time is stored in db.

[ ] (1:00?) push
     calls the get function above, then bup restore, then rsync's the result to username@host

[ ] (1:00?) browse functionality (in hub) -- just ensure there is an updated localcopy, then give back directory listing to project *owner* only.








----


[ ] (0:45) "var('x','y')" has to work, since it works in Sage.

[ ] (1:00) MAJOR BUG: click on a 15MB tarball by accident via the file manager, and local hub breaks, and file never comes up; no way to recover.  Impossible for a normal user!

[ ] (1:00, at least) Downloading a 15MB tarball from the cloud thing doesn't work.

[ ] (0:15?) get sagetex to work on all compute machines, and repeat this procedure on a new base vm, so it will be permanent.  Also, make it part of the install process when updating sage.

    sudo cp /usr/local/sage/sage-5.9/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex/sagetex.sty /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/sagetex/


[ ] (0:20?) install into base machine all the packages harald mentioned.


[ ] (0:30?) path at top doesn't have to be fixed (note how it looks when scrolling)
[ ] (0:30?) search output doesn't have to have fixed height + own scroll

[ ] (0:10?) https://mathsaas.com/ points at cloud.sagemath.org (really bsd), but should point at the .com.

[ ] (1:00?) Create "%md" markdown that has inline backtick code, then zoom by increasing font size and that code doesn't get bigger.


[ ] (2:00?) make it so there are never terminal disconnects; also, when user exits terminal, restart it automatically when they hit a key (?)
[ ] (3:00?) first sync -- cursor jumps back 6 characters; worksheets show secret codes

---

[ ] (1:00?) (0:10+)fix terminal resize; bottom line is often cut off.

[ ] (1:00?) feature: save terminal history to file.

[ ] (1:00?) feature: keyboard shortcut to move between files.

[ ] (1:00?) feature: bring back custom eval keys in settings

[ ] (1:00?) feature: run sagetex automatically (?)  maybe have checkbox to enable/disable in page that lists log.


[ ] (1:00?) html/md and non-ascii doesn't work, but it should, e.g, this goes boom.
%md
Very Bad Thingâ„¢.

[ ] (1:00?) MAJOR; sage bug -- forgot the flush at the end of eval when adding back buffering, so, e.g., some output doesn't appear.
 Test case:

 for x in s.split("\na\nb\n"):
    if x:
        print x

Doing

sys.stdout.flush()

works at the end, but doing

sys.stdout.flush(done=True)

or

sys.stdout.flush(done=False)

doesn't... so I suspect the bug is in `local_hub`'s handling of messages.

[ ] (1:00?) upgrade bup everywhere -- looks like fsck and race condition work is recent: https://github.com/bup/bup

[ ] (1:00?) when using an interact on cloud.sagemath.com that produces graphics (lecture 17 of 308), I'm seeing the image in
 output not appearing with some probability.  I'm guessing this has to do with how files get sent from local hub to hub, and there being multiple global hubs... and them not using the database always.

 [ ] (1:00?) interact dropdown selector doesn't work in Firefox -- shows blank input.

 [ ] (1:00?) suggest sync broadcast message often doesn't work (maybe on first sync?), i.e., user has to modify buffer to see latest changes upstream

 [ ] (1:00?) idea: make a stats tab -- for all to see -- under "?" page with:

 [ ] (1:00?) idea: when displaying lots of output, scroll output area to BOTTOM (not top like it is now).

 [ ] (1:30?) make worksheet save persist linked objects

 [ ] (1:30?) new project default git creds based on project owner cred. (?);

 [ ] (1:30?) ability to open sws files

 [ ] (1:00?) button in settings to reset the smc server

 [ ] (1:30?) ability to delete projects.

 [ ] (1:30?) ability to change project to be private.

 [ ] (1:00?) make hub do "bup fsck -g" regularly.

 [ ] (1:30?) when restoring a project using a bup backup, make it robust in face of hub not actually having the backup it claims to have; this could possibly involve scrubbing db every once in a while too.  Also, just investigate possibility of storing these backups in cassandra *somehow.*

 [ ] consider using https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs for storing all user projects in a distributed way; bup isn't reliable enough.

 [ ] worksheet fail with local_hub log:
         Trace
            at process.daemon.pidFile (/mnt/home/D6VXKxGo/.sagemathcloud/node_modules/local_hub.js:1986:24)
            at process.EventEmitter.emit (events.js:126:20)
            at Timer.list.ontimeout (timers.js:104:21)
         error: Uncaught exception: Error: This socket is closed.

 [ ] (1:30?) implement pretty_print -- see https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/13e454cb56930ef0

 [ ] (1:00) write script that does "ping()" from cloud1 and cloud3 (say), and sends me an email if anything doesn't respond to ping in 10 seconds (or something like that).

 [ ] (2:00) when a compute server fails to work for n seconds, re-deploy project elsewhere, automatically.

 [ ] (0:30?) %hideall doesn't hide output, but should.

 [ ] (1:00?) add a way to self-report donation (get recorded in database)

 [ ] (3:00?) why does editing feel so slow: take 2?

 [ ] (2:00?)  `local_hub`: pushes out output *too* often/quickly; make a for loop and can easily kill the browser with sync requests...


[ ] (1:00?) idea: multiline copy from a terminal should delete trailing whitespace... if possible.  I don't know if this is possible, and don't know how this could even be implemented in general.  However, maybe when cloud.sagemath is used as an extension or chromeapp, then it would be possible...

 - [ ] (1:00?) quota in my "devel" project looks suspicious (type "quota -v").; on compute2a everything is fine.  No clue what is going on here.

- (3:00?) [ ] sagews html editing: try using tinymce to edit %html cells -- editing the output would modify the input (but keep hidden ?)  NEW release! http://www.tinymce.com/

- (1:00?) [ ] highlight some blank space at bottom and do "shift-enter" -- get lots of new empty cells.
- (0:30?) [ ] account creation: checking that user clicked on the terms button -- fix it.
- (2:00?) [ ] way to browse other people's projects
- (0:45?) [ ] sagews: javascript(once=True) isn't respected; needs to use a different channel... (broadcast?)
- (0:45?) [ ] sagews: in %md cell mode, bold is nearly invisible due to some CSS error. Ugh.

- (2:00?) [ ] make caching of newly created blank projects something that is stored in the database, not the hub.

- (?) [ ] some logs get HUGE:
wstein@u:~/salvus/salvus/data/logs$ du -sch *
    873M    haproxy-0.log
    296M    nginx-0.log
    1.6G    stunnel-0.log


- (1:00?) [ ] sagews bug -- html.iframe gets updated/refreshed on all executes. why?

- (0:45?) [ ] sagews: caching of images permanently... ?  what to do about that?

- (1:00?) [ ] sagews: timer when evaluating code, but don't use jquery countdown, since it wastes resources at all times.

- (0:45?) [ ] sagews: eliminate jquery countdown (while not breaking old worksheets)
- (0:30?) [ ] sagews: proper filename display / truncation

- (1:00?) [ ] syncdoc: last edit sometimes doesn't cause other clients to sync -- broadcast doesn't happen or clients ignore request -- maybe not implemented (?)

- (0:10?) [ ] syncdoc: remove "click_save_button:" from syncdoc.coffee, in case it is not used (I think it isn't).

- (3:00?) [ ] sagews: re-implement interact (using exec message)

- (1:00?) [ ] syncdoc: store sync history for each file on filesystem (next to chat)

- (2:00?) [ ] syncdoc: browse through past versions -- "some sort of timeline view".

- (1:00?) [ ] sagews: modify search command to indicate result in output more sensibly (right now cursor gets big next to output)
- (1:00?) [ ] Modify the editor find command to have the option of doing a "fuzzy search" using the diff-patch-match library?!
* (1:00?) [ ] FEATURE: make it so "create a new file" allows you to just paste a URL in the filename blank... to get a file from the web!
* (0:15?) [ ] BUG: need block of empty whitespace at bottom of cell.
* (0:20?) [ ] BIG BUG: worksheets -- the css position of tab completion is wrong; it doesn't move with the worksheet! (not sure I care)
* (0:30?) [ ] BUG: terminal path is not set correctly.
* (1:00?) [ ] BUG: don't allow editing a file if it is above a certain relatively small size...
* (0:45?) [ ] BUG: clearing the "recent files" list makes it so none of the open file tabs at the top of the screen work anymore. (for now, maybe don't clear the ones also at top?)
* (0:30?) [ ] MAJOR BUG: when a worksheet asks for a non-existent session, it should failover and ask for a new session; right now it doesn't.
* (1:00?) [ ] BUG: terminal sessions need to reconnect when they timeout!
* (0:45?) [ ] SYNC: infinite loop printout in worksheet kills everything... NEED rate limiting of burst output, etc., like for terminals.
* (0:45?) [ ] SYNC BUG: often we start editing a document on *first sync* (only) the cursor moves back 4 characters. WHY?  (Facebook on android does this same thing, incidentally!)
* (0:30?) [ ] BUG: file browser destroys long filenames now.
* (0:15?) [ ] BUG: after pasting something big in terminal paste blank, page gets scrolled up all wrong.
* (1:30?) [ ] sagews: default worksheet percent modes.
* (1:00?) [ ] BUG in sage execute: "divide into blocks" to respect code decorators, plus fix ugly recombination of if/while/etc.
* (0:30?) [ ] DESIGN: After doing certain operations with checked cells, uncheck them all: hide/show ops.
* (0:45?) [ ] BUG: when editing a doc with multiple viewers, keep having codemirror view on doc jump to top of screen (i.e., cursor at top)
* (0:45?) [ ] BUG: move recent files (etc.) thing to the database; it's too frustrating/confusing tieing to the computer.
* (0:30?) [ ] BUG: os x "control-o" should also accept command-o
* (0:30?) [ ] BUG: switching between projects to redisplay an editor can result in a corrupt display; need to call "show" for visible editor on both resize and show top navbar events.



    [ ] (1:00?) interact: debug/test -- make one worksheet with all interacts?
    [ ] (1:00?) interact.coffee: refactor the big switch statement in interact_control to be extensible, so can easily add something to a map and get a new control.

# DONE

* (0:45?) [x] BUG -- editor synchronization and split docs aren't done -- cursor/selection in bottom doc gets messed up -- sync the window with focus?
* (0:30?) [x] BUG: worksheet path is still not set correctly
*(0:30?)  [x] (0:14) apply security updates and reboot 01salvus (done) and 06salvus (done)
* (0:30?) [x] Add a new tab at the top called "Explore" that is to the left of "Your Projects"

= UX =
(0:20?)  [x] (0:06) do not delete whitespace on line that contains the cursor (codemirror plugin)
(0:20?)  [x] (0:22) in project file listing search, make it so that the *other* hidden files are not clickable!
(0:45?)  [x] (0:14) cursor replication when sync starts -- might have fixed it -- NOT SURE!
(0:30?)  [x] (0:30) after entering a command in project command line, focus should *stay* on command line.
(1:00?)  [x] (1:55)  create a new file/directory;default filename for terminal and worksheet date/time iso format
(0:30?)  [x] (0:16) the alert message tab thing covers the connection settings.

(0:20?)  [x] (0:40) bug: sometimes clicking the x to close an open file (in file editor pills) just leaves it -- even though counter goes down; then it can't be closed; this is also why sometimes searching the list of open files doesn't work.;   ALSO did more work on new file page (which took most of the time)

(0:30?)  [x] (0:06) project: When changing project title, should auto change the entry in the tab at the top.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:08) editor - the undo buffer should *NOT* start with buffer empty, but with result of loading content!!!

(1:30?)  [x] (0:50) make it so project nav tabs hide when showing editor; make codemirror edit window "FULL SCREEN" always
         [x] (0:36) greatly improve style of top bar due to fullscreening
(0:45?)  [x] (1:30) make worksheet edit window "FULL SCREEN" always; still not so clean!

(0:45?)  [x] (1:43) make terminal edit window "FULL SCREEN" always -- and cleaned up some related things all over, especially proper resizing math.
(0:20?)  [x] (0:17) file selector -- putting slash at end in search should restrict to directories.
(0:20?)  [x] (0:08) create new file by typing a name that results in no hits in file search creates it... with a button to choose type (or cancel)
(1:00?)  [x] (0:59) editors need to have "show" called when window is resized; also, get rid of responsive top bar bullshit and do it right.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:59) idea -- what if we allow opening the same project in multiple tabs -- then get multiple views on same project.  Not good. Instead, usable implementation of files as tabs optionally to try out...
(1:00?)  [x] way to make a new folder
(1:00?)  [x] (1:00) way to rename file
(0:30?)  [x] (0:42) delete/download file icons should only appear on hover; also, added a link for importing files from the web (will use wget)
         [x] (1:10) refactoring and cleanup of file listing code.
(0:45?)  [x] (0:42) way to delete files; just moves to project_path/.trash, making that directory if necessary and printing a message
(0:30?)  [x] (0:30) close all recently opened files.
(1:00?)  [x] (1:13) import files form web using wget --- make it live; add a slider for how long it will try to download until giving up.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:15) way to browse trash can
(0:30?)  [x] (0:36) way to empty trash can
(1:30?)  [x] (0:59) way to move files into a folder by dragging them.
(0:30?)  [x] fix auto-resizing of input cells of worksheet
(0:30?)  [x] (0:40) show hidden files toggle (icon?) -- also fixed misc trash-can related bugs
         [x] (0:09) slight improvements to css of open files
(0:30?)  [x] (0:14) error message when file doesn't load should not be *in* codemirror
(0:30?)  [x] (0:18) need a "save all open files" button somewhere (in editor's list of open files page)
(0:45?)  [x] (0:16) bug -- worksheet tab completion is now broken (actually underneath) worksheets...; also fix vertical resizing as options for worksheet cells
(0:15?)  [x] (0:10) need to save worksheet on creation, so next load has a chance to work.

(0:45?)  [x] (1:06) make it so the little project tab bar is *always* visible, just below the main nav bar.  Will require care about fullscreen size for each.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:27) get rid of code that always switches to recent and vanishes editor on selecting tab -- just leave as is; add "open file/folder" button
(0:20?)  [x] (0:42) list of files in file browser for project needs to be scrollable and have fixed height.
(0:15?)  [x] (0:11) file rename -- should have to click twice to activate?

(0:10?)  [x] (0:15) bug: control-o in editor to get to recent is broken

With the following done, we will have 100% fixed the UI for now:

(0:30?)  [x] (0:45) do not actually open a tab in editor unless the user explicitly selects it.  Make this lazy.  this was we can leave recent as is.

(1:00?)  [x] (0:50) PLAN THIS: each open file *must* corr to a tab in the second line bar. Sorry.  Get rid of the path up there and put a big pull-ed right
             tabbar up.  Shrink to accom. arbitrary many.
(0:30?)  [x] (make project nav area full with

(0:10?)  [x] (0:15) move little upper right path

(0:30?)  [x] (0:30) stacked cursors issue -- local hub should only allow global hub once as a client for given file.
              doubled cursors issue is now fixed.

(1:30?) [x] (0:30)  when visiting a synchronized editing session after a long time (and sync broken), the first few
        characters typed get jumbled.   I'm not going to worry more about this, since it *only* happens if
        the local_hub goes down... and maybe then some loss is inevitable.  This is not something (like user's connection or global hub change)
        that will happen much.
(0:45?) [x] cursor doubling -- this is because the same hub connects twice to the same local_hub and broadcasts to itself.
                Solution: when connecting to local_hub, local_hub should discard all connections from that same hub.
                Could be determined by a self-reported uuid on startup of global hub.
(1:00?)  [x] (0:15) clean up the bar at the top of worksheets; make consistent with files...
         [x] Make background color of worksheets consistent... and easy to change later.
 (0:30?) [x] (0:30) when showing worksheet, need to call refresh on all cells in the worksheet


(0:30?)  [x] (1:05) range selection -- need to also preserve that on sync.  (harder than I thought!)

        [x] (0:22) make the trash can vastly more usable using move's amazing "backup" option; add file list refresh option.

(0:30?)  [x] (1:20) make it so the chat window appears again.
(0:45?) [x] re-enable (and test) automatic timeout of sync sessions in local_hub

 (0:45?)  [x] (0:37) bug in directory download -- need to name things sensibly; may require changes in hubs.


(0:30?) [x] (1:10) download a project, etc.

(0:45?)  [x] (0:13) bug: worksheet -- default path is relative to home directory not project.
(0:15?)  [x] bug -- "Results of searching" needs to be scrollable.

 [x] just did a very quick proof-of-concept of editor pages being tabs... It really just needs polish,  but will work.  need to move... can move.  THIS IS AWESOME!

(0:10?)  [x] make other standard tabs only icons; move search box to search page only
(0:30?)  [x] move editor tab placement to project code and tabs -- each open file is in a project tab; code will need to be refactored.


(0:20?) [x] (0:23) PDF preview is probably not correct height... I'm good at this now.

        [x] (0:12) PDF preview -- easy to make it 2-up? -- at least play for a moment

(0:45?) [x] (0:19) pdf preview doesn't work on ipad -- this is because no security cert yet, so this will go away!.  I figured this out using
            the awesome remote ipad dev console.
(0:30?) [x] (1:00) evaluate button for cells in worksheet.

[x] (1:30) worksheet timers, etc.

 (0:45?) [x] (0:49) project UI: did something like this, but general cleanup instead --  combine the two search pages, with the file search in the right side of page.  (?)


(0:45?)  [x] (1:07) editor buttons: search/replace/undo/redo/autoindent/shift left/shift right; plus tooltips.
(0:30?)  [x] (1:00) buttons in terminal: increase font, decrease font, paste spot, refresh, then title
(0:10?)  [x] (0:14) bug -- save all should only save things that are already open; plus some style cleanup
(0:45?)  [x] (0:43) codemirror split screen editing.  I NEED IT.  Now I gots it.
(0:30?)  [x] (1:22) tabs -- make them shrink as more are added; also fix some serious bug/issues with split editing.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:05) feature -- open new documents on creation.


(1:00?)  [x] (0:28) change filename extensions: ".sage-worksheet", ".sage-terminal", ".sage-cell", ".sage-quiz", ".sage-backup", ".sage-chat", etc.

(0:30?)  [x] (0:05) bug -- can have the same filename twice in recent files if you make new file; e.g., make "a" worksheet twice.
[x] (0:21) make it so one can sort files by time or alphabetical
-
(0:15?)  [x] (0:04) ui bug: when selecting any of the top five things on left, they should get active and nothing else.

(0:30)   [x] (0:23) font size in editor; go to line in editor
(0:30?)  [x] bug: if you start clicking around directories quickly, you can easily get to a nonexistent path due to time of gitls round trip.  So... when that happens display the last valid path; save last working path, and don't change path to a directory that doesn't exist (as determined by an error from git-ls)

[x] (0:08) CSS and styling of terminal.
[x] disabled draggable of recent... since I didn't use it once today!
[x] (0:20) goto line keyboard shortcut; toggle split view shortcut.


(0:08?)  [x] (0:20) pdf preview -- make resolution function of width?
(1:00?)  [x] (3:30) bug -- when reconnecting to a TERMINAL session, it display a bunch of garbage codes.

(0:10?) [x] bug -- add or delete open file pill should result in a resize all (not just on add)

(1:00?)  [x] (0:46) get ssl cert setup for cloud.sagemath.org:

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cloud.sagemath.key -out cloud.sagemath.csr
IO2wMWk7
01salvus: 128.95.224.230
06salvus: 128.95.242.135


(1:00?) [x] (0:16) change any hard coded "salv.us" to cloud.sagemath.org

--> * (0:30?) [ ] BUG: loading some worksheets is DOUBLE DOG slow.  WHY??
This issue is CRITICAL.   It seems like every codemirror editor is taking like a half second to do something in response to a window resize event. This isn't good.   WHY?  Ideas of things to do:
   x - make a simple standalone page to try to emulate this; maybe I am misconfiguring something: -- NOPE, it is very slow (!)
   x - what if they are all set to read-only mode: total fail; still very slow.
   x - ipython isn't nearly so slow... but is also using an old version of codemirror.
   x - try making a bunch of editors and *one* shared doc -- they each edit a separate range of lines.  Will this help?
     Didn't try, since I REALLY doubt it, given what is taking time.
   x - I did upgrade codemirror to 3.11, which breaks the ReST mode (I don't use it), but is otherwise not really
       any different.

   I must address this issue.  I really want to try again my idea to have the entire worksheet be inside of a single
   codemirror editor, with the output as html widgets.  That would have the potential to *scale up hugely*.
   When I add back sectioning/pages/slides, each section/page/slide, etc. will be such a codemirror editor.

   cm.addLineWidget(line: integer|LineHandle, node: Element, ?options: object)

This will be some work, so let's plan it out. I've tried this 2-3 times before, and always FAILED, so let's hope this time is different.

--> * (0:45?) [ ] make a detailed plan for an worksheet-in-an-editor

# The look
- A worksheet will *look* exactly like a single codemirror document, except:
1. We will utilize line widgets to influence how much code is evaluated when you press "shift-enter", and to "insert a new cell".
2. The output of code evaluation will be entirely in a CodeMIrror "Line Widget", and will use all the same code I already wrote, e.g., for interact.

Question: in codemirror, is it possible to use markText to put a border around a block of text?  ANSWER: *NO.*

However, it is possible to use markText to do everything we need for output, to do code folding, etc.

* (0:10?) [x] (0:06) make a class called "WorksheetDocument" that derives from "class SynchronizedDocument" in syncdoc.coffee.


* (0:10?) [x] (0:07) make it so editor opens sagews using the new class.
* (0:15?) [x] (0:04) add handling a keyboard event to the codemirror for "shift-enter".  -- just print something to log

* (0:20?) [x] (0:11) cm-sync-worksheets: add code to detect the block that needs to be evaluated when a shift-enter happens. This is the max in both directions until edge of editor or hit an output line.  An output line is defined to be
[MARKER]uuid

* (0:15?) [x] (0:21) cm-sync-worksheets: bring over code for having a Sage session attached to the worksheet

* (0:15?) [x] (1:00) cm-sync-worksheets: when user shift-enters above, send the code to be evaluated and create a corresponding div for output, along with a callback.

* (0:15?) [x] cm-sync-worksheets: write something to handle output messages: when get a message tagged with a uuid, will search editor for [MARKER]uuid, find linemarker corresponding to that line (or make one if there is none), then insert output in that line.  Try again later if such a line doesn't exist.

* [x] (0:15) Try out the above and see if it "feels" good, especially with the syncing that will automatically just work.

* (0:10?) [x] (0:20) cm-sync-worksheets: correctly embed the uuid of each computation

* (0:15?) [ ] cm-sync-worksheets: right after doing sync, need to search for any new [MARKER]uuid's and mark them (so user doesn't see them)

PLAN:

Can I store data in the output line that is synchronized across worksheets and invisible to user?  YES!

    - EXECUTE: message to local hub to execute cell with this id

    - ALL output is via local hub modifying the master document's output line (via 1-line json),
      clients seeing that modification and interpreting it.

0: meta information about this; json object; e.g., modes for cells.
1: [start-cell-marker][uuid of cell]metadata[marker]contents of cells...
       metadata = set of letters
         - e = need to execute
         - h = hide input
         - o = hide output
         -
       use the metadata to specify that the cell is ready to run.
.. more contents ..
n: [output-marker][uuid of output] {}[output-sep]{}...[output-marker] <-- output goes here as json messages all on one line, separated by a marker; rendered by client.  This is ONE CodeMirror marked text area.
?: [start-marker][uuid of cell]contents of cells...
.. more contents ..
?: [output-marker]{} <-- output goes here as json messages all on one line
...

[x] (0:18) Make a fairly complete plan to implement core of the above idea

(0:20?) [x]  (0:48)local hub: when starting a codemirror session and file extension is sagews, *ensure* that a corresponding sage session is available.  No need to reconnect or store an existing session, etc., since local hub *is* the lifetime of the session!

--> (0:45?) [x] (2:45) local hub: support a new "execute" message, which takes uuid of cell as only input.  This should probably be just combined with the sync message as an optional additional action, to avoid latency issues.  Also, make client send this message on doing "shift-enter" (say).   This will determine what code to execute, submit it to the sage process, delete existing output, create a new cell if necessary, etc.; all this will get pushed out via the sync system.
Another optimization will be to wait up to 100ms (?) say for output messages and only complete the sync after applying them, so they are all sent back together immediately.
NOTE: output messages do *not* need to have an id tag on them -- that would be wasteful.

WAIT -- instead, we'll mark the document

- (0:15?) [x] test/debug the above, which should work and allow for synchronized sessions with output appearing in all of them.  Then plan further.

PHASE 2: get something that works that is in `local_hub` (hence everywhere and synchronized)

- (0:20?) [x] (0:40) do processing on client side of new input from server after sync (i.e., use mark text).
- (0:20?) [x] (1:00) make it so that when localhub runs code, it deletes old output line and creates new output line
--> - (0:20?) [ ] make it so that when localhub evaluates code, it sends it to sage process and also listens for results and puts them in the appropriate output cells (if they exist).
- (0:25?) [ ] make it so client parses and renders any results appearing in output location, tracking what it has done so far.





- (0:10?) [x] sagews: get rid of trailing whitespace on eval
- (0:30?) [x] (0:49) sagews: reset CSS inside div output
- (0:20?) [x] (0:38) sagews: nice horizontal line between cells
- (0:10?) [x] (1:02) sagews: when evaluating a cell, put the end of the cell as *high* as possible (not low) -- no whitespace lines. -- took a long time due to confusion regarding a bug caused by my cursor location code and merging.
- (0:30?) [x] sagews/editor: try to fix cursor merge bug found above.  -- I think the only valid approach it to fully implement the right algorithm. Bandaide now, which will be to insert newline before any output cells introduced by a merge.  Want this anyways...
- (0:15?) [x] (0:09) sagews: what's up with infinite loop exec'ing nothing in localhub?

- (0:20?) [x] (0:33) sagews: click on separator to make a new cell; make hovering over it change color (?)

- (0:20?) [x] (0:18) sagews: when client executes code with shift-enter, move the cursor to next input cell

- (0:10?) [x] (0:08) sagews: make split screen mode work so I can play with it; if it is not useful or slow, kill it (?) -- let's make it a different view; seems useful for it to be "hide all output".

[marker.input][uuid of cell][metadata][marker.start]
...
input content of the cell
...
[marker.output][output uuid of cell][marker.output]{json output mesg}[marker.output]{json output mesg}[marker.output]...[marker.output]

 - (1:00?) [x] sagews: switch to directly applying the patches to the codemirror buffer, since right now, the *entire* output is being re-rendered every single time... since all the marks go away on sync.; this will be a few lines of code in syncdoc.coffee

- (1:30?) [x] (0:20) sagews: design/implement a way to make evaluation of code blocks optimally fast for the client requesting a specific eval.  This is absolutely critical, and could impact other design choices, so let's get it done.   [I just tweaked a standard sync parameter... but it feels much more usable now.  Maybe just optimizing sync is the way to go.]

- (1:00?) [x] sagews: misc robustness cleanups related to processing control codes



- [x] (this took a day!) setup new chromebook running salvus
- (0:15?) [x] (0:13) codemirror execute code -- define message
- (0:20?) [x] (1:00) codemirror exec message: route through hub properly
- (0:20?) [x] (0:35) codemirror exec message: handle in local hub, and test in client
- (0:30?) [x] (0:40?) codemirror sync session: add introspection messages
- (0:20?) [x] (0:20) sagews: implement tab completion without UI using the codemirror introspection messages
- (0:45?) [x] (1:12) sagews: ui for introspection -- completions
- (0:45?) [x] (1:05) sagews: ui for introspection -- docstring and source code
- (0:15?) [x] sagews: hub/ local hub: support sending signals to sage process; also make "esc" and "control-c" interrupt the process

- (0:15?) [x] (0:30) sagews: set path of session on startup to same as file.

- (0:15?) [x] (0:13+) sagews: make it so "sagews" are the worksheets (basically change what the new button makes)

- (0:10?) [x] (0:22) hide line 0 and make line numbering start at 0 to avoid a lot of confusion for users.

- (0:20?) [x] (0:25) sending blobs from local hub codemirror/sage sessions, so that we can look at autogenerated c code during class more easily!


 (1:00?) [x] (3:00) upgrade cassandra, to see if I can store projects in db then.  Maybe old cassandra was just broken?!


- (0:15?) [x] (0:08) creating new file puts [object Object] at the end of the name.
- (1:00?) [x] (0:45) why is it (mainly worksheets) so damned slow while typing -- rendering everything every time.


* figure out what the deal is with timeouts when storing large data:
   - changing helenus timeout definitely doesn't help
   - what about using python driver? *SAME* fail.  So it is on the server side.

     import cassandra
     cassandra.KEYSPACE = 'test'
     cassandra.NODES=['localhost']
     a = cassandra.UUIDValueStore('x')
     a[u] = 'x'*(int(2*1e7))  # BOOM!
    [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
    Connected to localhost

I added 00 to the end of two constants in data/local/cassandra/cassandra.yaml and the problem vanished, so this
is a server-side configuration issue, which is easy to resolve.  Thus storing user projects in the database is an
option, at least.

    # Frame size for thrift (maximum field length).
    thrift_framed_transport_size_in_mb: 1500

    # The max length of a thrift message, including all fields and
    # internal thrift overhead.
    thrift_max_message_length_in_mb: 1600




- (0:45?) [x] sagews: in local hub when code execution done, instead of including a message with done:true, change state of cell from "r" to not.
- (0:30?) [x] (0:19) sagews: visually change state of editor when code exec is requested ("x"), is executing ("r" mode)
- (0:30?) [x] (0:12) sagews: tab on a new line tries to complete on empty instead of inserting a tab
- (0:45?) [x] (1:00) sagews: evaluate and insert new cell at bottom should move cursor to new cell
- (0:30?) [x] (0:51) sagews: handle paste better -- don't ever show codes
- (0:30?) [x] (1:30) sagews: handle undo/redo better -- dont' show codes; it just has too much in the undo buffer...; removed custom cursor handling.  Current plan: mark some undo steps as "skip", and on undo, do another undo when hit a skip.  This took longer than expected, but seems OK.

- (0:30?) [x] (0:10) sagews: implement alt-enter to evaluate without moving the cursor, since I need that for teaching.

- (0:45?) [x] (0:35) sagews: control-enter evaluate and split; ctrl-; = split cell

- (0:45?) [x] (0:43) sagews: make it so cursor is never invisible... or better, if it enters a marked line, it is moved out automatically.  For example, put cursor at end of a cell input and type r or x then move cursor out, and we get a spinner!

- (0:20?) [x] (0:20) editor: refresh after font resize

- (0:45?) [x] (0:20+) sagews: play button to submit code to execute
- (0:45?) [x] sagews: button to interrupt code to execute
- (0:45?) [x] sagews: button to kill sage process
- (0:15?) [x] sagews: button to split cell

- (0:30?) [x] (0:38) sagews: toggling input/output hide: via keyboard shortcut
- (0:20?) [x] (0:18) sagews: double click output to toggle input
- (0:30?) [x] (0:06) sagews: fix sync bugs with toggling input/output.
- (0:15?) [x] sagews: modify input/output toggle functions so they apply to entire selected range, which is far more powerful.
- (0:30?) [x] sagews: implement gui for toggling input hide: icon at top or gutter

- (0:30?) [x] (0:37) sagews: re-implementing the javascript and coffeescript commands

- (1:00?) [x] (1:00) sagews: make salvus.hide/show work via new output message by directly modifying doc on local hub; safer, more secure, and far more efficient; rewrite %hide mode / command -- support it (so %md works with it)

- (0:45?) [x] (1:42) sagews: dynamic syntax highlight modes in each cell

- (0:30?) [x]  (1:18) %auto decorator; super useful, so make it work! -- finally, this time I think it is right; no bullshit parsing or hacks.

- (0:30?) [x] (0:30) sagews: make markdown mode optionally leaves content of $'s untouched (wraps them all in spans?); but should *still* allow $a\_1$ for compatibility -- I just enabled "code\_friendly", for the worksheet, which does what we want...

- (1:00?) [x] (0:07) sage server: fix parsing of blocks to not string whitespace, since that tricks certain % modes.
- (0:45?) [x] (0:22) tooltip over connecting speed looks absurd

- (0:30?) [x] (0:15) bug: yesterday I made it so two new cell dividers are created when evaluating. Wow/how/what?


- (0:45?) [x] (0:31) fix latex editor so usable; need it to write an exam!
- (0:15?) [x] remove google protobuf; I'm not using it all

- (1:00?) [x] (0:51) backups:  include bup in salvus itself (instead of system wide), for install stability.

I am going to use bup for backups -- https://github.com/bup/bup/

 [x] (3:00?) Ability to make a *complete* efficient dump of system state to an archive:
     [x] (0:05?) create new file "backup.coffee"
     [x] (0:15?) backup: create a class with methods for each of the following, and one that does all; stubs.
     [x] (0:10?) backup: ensure init of a bup archive for target
     [x] (0:15?) (0:25) backup: connect to database and obtain list of all projects (by uuid) and their current location
     [x] (0:30?) (1:01) backup: bup each project to target (branch=uuid), excluding .sagemathcloud and .sage paths.

    bup on d9b8d530@localhost index --exclude .bup --exclude .sage --exclude .sagemathcloud --exclude .forever --exclude .cache --exclude .fontconfig --exclude .texmf-var .

After updating the index, can do this to see exactly what changed (if anything) to know if there is a need to make a backup; this is not so useful if anything else is backing up same projects.

    bup on d9b8d530@localhost index -m -s

Now make backup:

    export BUP_DIR=data/backup/bup/
    bup on d9b8d530@localhost save --strip -9 -n a835a7a5-508c-44a9-90d2-158b9f07db87 .

And restore:

    bup restore a835a7a5-508c-44a9-90d2-158b9f07db87/latest/. --outdir=xyz

Browse live backup:

    mkdir data/backup/live
    bup fuse data/backup/live
    fusermount -u data/backup/live  # must do this before any new additions will appear!


    fusermount -u data/backup/live >/dev/null; mkdir -p data/backup/live; bup fuse data/backup/live
    ls  data/backup/live

     [x] (0:49) backup: ran project backup on cloud.sagemath.org and fixed a number of issues.

Put this in backup.coffee as thing that gets going; maybe hub will start it, maybe hub won't.  We can test it outside hub.

1. find all projects touched in the last k minutes
2. query for snapshots with this hub as host of those projects having a backup in the last k minutes
3. for any that don't have a  snapshot, make a snapshot

- (0:30?) [x] deploy: make sure 4 machines have kernel opts that Keith reported are needed now for reboot to work: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/13e2db89829eed81







     [x] (1:00?) (4:30-- way, way longer than expected. Wow.) add a function "restore_project" to backup, which takes as input a project_id, location, timeout, and optional time, and restores project to that location.  If the time is given, find snapshot with closest time and uses it; otherwise use globally newest snapshot.   If timeout elapses and can't contact snapshot location, try again with next best one. If location doesn't exist, give error.

    [x] (0:45?) (1:05) when opening project, if no location doesn't exist, resume from *latest* working global bup snapshot, if there is one.

    [x] (0:30?) (0:04) in backup.coffee, address this: "HOST = 'localhost' # TODO"


 [x] (2:00) Define deployment file/conf.
     [x] (0:30?) (0:30) write the file based on existing one.  4 hosts; 1 web machine per; 1 db machine per; n compute per.
     [x] (0:45?) (0:45) Learn how latest easier-to-expand Cassandra cluster now works; update conf accordingly.
     [x] (0:45?) Reduce some firewalling, at least for outgoing connections from user compute machines (so they can use the net); this is not needed, due to not having a "compute" server anymore.


 [ ] Deploy -- this could take WAY longer, depending on bugs/issues we find!
     [x] (0:15?) update salvus on vm

    virsh_list
    export PREV=salvus-20130425; export NAME=salvus-20130427;
    qemu-img create -b ~/vm/images/base/$PREV.img -f qcow2 ~/vm/images/base/$NAME.img
    virt-install --cpu host --network user,model=virtio --name $NAME --vcpus=16 --ram 32768 --import --disk ~/vm/images/base/$NAME.img,device=disk,bus=virtio,format=qcow2,cache=writeback --noautoconsole
    virsh -c qemu:///session qemu-monitor-command --hmp $NAME 'hostfwd_add ::2222-:22'; ssh localhost -p 2222

    [x] (0:30?) )(0:04) install bup system-wide on base vm.

sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev python-fuse python-pyxattr python-pylibacl linux-libc-dev
git clone git://github.com/bup/bup
cd bup; sudo make install
cd ..; sudo rm -rf bup

    [x] (1:00?) (2:00) create account creation script so salvus@vm != root@vm, and accounts created in /mnt/home/

This requires putting -- via visudo -- this line:

      salvus ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:  /home/salvus/salvus/salvus/scripts/create_unix_user.py ""

   [x] (0:15?) (0:06) setup skel/ on base vm to have .sagemathcloud path.

rsync -axvHL local_hub_template/ ~/.sagemathcloud/
cd ~/.sagemathcloud
time ./build # takes 40 seconds
tar jcvf sagemathcloud.tar .sagemathcloud
cd salvus/salvus/scripts/skel/
tar xvf ~/sagemathcloud.tar

   [x] (0:20?) (0:04) make sure account creation script is actually run on the right computer.

-->   [ ] (0:45?) (+0:17) ensure quotas are setup and work on base vm.

sudo apt-get install quota quotatool

I added this to /etc/rc.local:

if [ -d /mnt/home ]; then
    touch /mnt/home/aquota.user /mnt/home/aquota.group
    quotaon -a
fi

####

Now debug this:

    ./vm.py --ip_address=10.1.1.2 --hostname=compute1 --disk=home:1 --base=salvus-20130427


It turns out quota support was removed from ubuntu (?!): http://www.virtualmin.com/node/23522

   apt-get install linux-image-extra-virtual

# if this works, do this to the base image ... and put a note in build.py


     [x] (1:00?) (0:15) setup tinc vpn between cloud1,2,3,4, since I can't get anywhere further without that.

     [x] (0:05) config tinc on base vm then remove any git stuff:
       git reset --soft HEAD^
       git reset HEAD conf/tinc_hosts/salvus-base


     [x] (0:20?) in base vm, get rid of touching files in /mnt/home/ on startup to enable quota -- this is wrong.


 ---

     [x] (1:30?) serious problem -- user machines: accounts vanish since /etc/passwd etc are gone on reboot.
                 need a solution, e.g., maybe copy those files over to persistent when making a new account,
                 and restore on boot.  since no actual passwords, should be safe.  Or recreate on reboot.
                 Making /etc/stuff a symlink does *NOT* work; must copy over.

     [x] (0:45?) make it so /tmp is "mount -o bind" to /mnt/home/tmp" so it gets that quota and has lots of space.

[ ] (3:00?) VM installs/deploys

     [x] (0:30?) create automated bup backups cloud1->cloud2, etc.; backup everything except vm images.
     [x] (1:00?) (1:00) bup of everything to disk, for an extra level of backup, since I have 4TB just sitting there unused (leave 1TB to expand /home); this is meant only for the next few months, not long term.

        xx - install bup systemwide

     [x] (0:30?) (0:06) setup DNS for cloud.sagemath.com


---

     [x] (0:30?) (0:16) use /mnt/backup instead of data/backup when possible (again, so persistent) -- just needs to be tested.

     [x] (1:00?) (0:38) make sure cassandra can have initialization of schema on first use if no schema; actually this must be done manually on adding a new node by doing this in python:

         import cassandra; cassandra.set_nodes(['localhost'])
         cassandra.init_salvus_schema('salvus')

     [x] (0:15?) (0:06) update salvus in a new base vm, and hosts

on cloud1:

     cd salvus; git pull  # type login/password
     ssh cloud2 "cd salvus && git pull cloud1:salvus/"
     ssh cloud3 "cd salvus && git pull cloud1:salvus/"
     ssh cloud4 "cd salvus && git pull cloud1:salvus/"

Start new base vm:

    export PREV=salvus-20130427; export NAME=salvus-20130428;
    qemu-img create -b ~/vm/images/base/$PREV.img -f qcow2 ~/vm/images/base/$NAME.img
    virt-install --cpu host --network user,model=virtio --name $NAME --vcpus=16 --ram 32768 --import --disk ~/vm/images/base/$NAME.img,device=disk,bus=virtio,format=qcow2,cache=writeback --noautoconsole
    virsh -c qemu:///session qemu-monitor-command --hmp $NAME 'hostfwd_add ::2222-:22'; ssh localhost -p 2222

     [x] (0:15?) (0:01) push out vm's
     [x] (0:10?) update services conf file base image; make cloud1/cloud3 the admins also, and re-update cloud1

     [x] (0:30?) (0:27) deploy: start stunnels and confirm working, fix issues
     [x] (0:30?) (1:02) deploy: start all vm's and confirm working, fix issues

     [x] (0:30?) (0:06)deploy: start haproxy's and confirm working, fix issues

     [x] (0:30?) deploy: start nginx and confirm working, fix issues

-->     [x] (1:00?) (0:59) deploy: start cassandra,  confirm working, fix issues

Won't start -- segfaults.
I do this:

    apt-get remove openjdk-6-*

so it will use the installed jdk-7.
Note that scilab gets removed too.
It starts!  But I see this in the log:
 INFO 15:43:24,786 JNA not found. Native methods will be disabled.

I try re-install scilab, which puts the java back to be old.
So I try:

    apt-get autoremove
    sudo update-alternatives --config java

now everything works.  Regarding JNA:

salvus@cassandra1:~/salvus/salvus/data/local/cassandra/lib$ ln -s /usr/share/java/jna.jar .

This works, but it still says:

  "OpenJDK is not recommended. Please upgrade to the newest Oracle Java release"

Stop all VM's
On base VM: Switch to Java JDK and should re-install cassandra

   apt-get install python-software-properties
   add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
   apt-get update
   apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
   update-alternatives --config java

---

NOw initialize databases on *one* node (it auto-propogates):

         cd salvus/salvus/; . salvus-env; ipython

         import cassandra; cassandra.set_nodes(['10.1.1.2'])   # etc. DO NOT USE 'localhost'
         cassandra.init_salvus_schema('salvus')

I then did this (see below):

        salvus@web3:~/salvus/salvus$ cqlsh -k salvus 10.1.1.2

  [x] (0:20?) fix the crappy bash prompt:


  [x] (0:30) remove "WARNING: This is a highly experimental unstable website. All data will definitely be randomly deleted without notice. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK." and restart web vm's.


 [x] (0:45?) test: password reset -- "Error sending password reset message to 'wstein@gmail.com'. Internal error sending password reset email to wstein@gmail.com."  LOG SAYS:

Shutdown all VM's and do the following to base machine:
   - create 'data/secrets/salvusmath_email_password'
   - update salvus repo.

Then restart everything and test again, including password reset.

  [x] TODO: 'Failed to create new project 'test4' -- "command 'ssh' (args=10.1.2.4 sudo salvus/salvus/scripts/create_unix_user.py) exited with nonzero code 255 -- stderr='Host key verification failed.\r\n'"'

  [x] test password reset again.

  [x] (1:00) add big link at front/top of cloud.sagemath.org VERY strongly suggesting users switch to cloud.sagemath.com.


  [x] make worksheet/file/etc creation easier by having a default name.
  [x] get rid of word "ping" in status (too much space)

  [x] debug and get project snapshotting working; this is very, very important!

  require('backup').backup(keyspace:'salvus', hosts:['10.1.1.2'], cb:(err,b) -> b.snapshot_active_projects(max_snapshot_age:1))

Solution: It was more of the strict host key business. I'm going to edit

/etc/ssh/ssh_config

in the base machine and put this line:

StrictHostKeyChecking no

then snapshots should work.  They already were working on machines where the
account was made.


  --> [x] update base vm and restart everything.


    cd salvus/salvus
    . salvus-env
    ipython
    import admin; s = admin.Services('conf/deploy_cloud/')

    git pull
    ./make_coffee
    # fix /etc/ssh/ssh_config
    sudo su
    apt-get update; apt-get upgrade
    reboot -h now
    sudo shutdown -h now


 Then

    cd vm/images/base/
    ./push

And

    cd salvus
    git pull
    push_salvus

Finally,

    cd salvus/salvus

Finally,

    cd salvus/salvus

Finally,

    cd salvus/salvus
    . salvus-env
    ipython
    import admin; s = admin.Services('conf/deploy_cloud/')
    s.start_system()
salvus-env
    ipython
    import admin; s = admin.Services('conf/deploy_cloud/')
    s.start_system()

    . salvus-env
    ipython
    import admin; s = admin.Services('conf/deploy_cloud/')
    s.start_system()


This worked well, I think....

[x] (1:00?) (0:44+) configure new 4TB disks on cloud3, cloud4

    use fdisk to format (1 4TB partition):
       fdisk /dev/sdb
       1 partition; type "8e" = "linux lvm"

    vgextend 03salvus /dev/sdb1

    Crap, fail. Obviously, we just got only 2TB more, not 4TB.  Mistake of using fdisk.
    Also, I forgot to do "pvcreate /dev/sdb1", which could be the problem.

    vgreduce 03salvus /dev/sdb1

    Start parted, then

    (parted) mklabel gpt
    (parted) unit TB
    FAIL

    apt-get install gdisk
    gdisk /dev/sdb
    # delete existing partition and make new 4TB 1; then set type to 8e00, then exit
    #

    pvcreate /dev/sdb1
    vgextend 03salvus /dev/sdb1

    # Now enlarge the logical volumn and partition!

When above resize2fs finishes and works, do this on cloud3:


      resize2fs /dev/mapper/03salvus-salvus_images


 [x] (1:00?) (0:50+ so far -- in progress in screen on cloud1) write script to automate, then upgrade deployed vm to sage-5.9: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-5.9/sage-5.9.tar
             - delete current sage version: 20130502
             - download and install/test from source in a next vm image
             - install markdown2
             - install list of good optional packages.

 [x] (0:30) more interact issues exposed by %exercise

 [x] (0:30) move file buttons to left (not way off to right).

 [x] (3:00?) - copy/paste in terminal sucks; look into hterm... -- HTERM is chrome-only according to <https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/chromium-hterm/K_I62Z6Gwuo>, hence not an option.

# May 5, 2013

 [x] (0:45) (0:31) clicking on filename should open file; make a rename button

 [x] (1:00) (0:10) upgrade to latest twitter bootstrap

 [x] (1:00) (0:30) upgrade to latest jquery & jquery-ui

 [x] (1:00) (0:10) upgrade to latest sockjs (0.3.2-->0.3.4 on client; 0.3.5-->0.3.7 on server)

 [x] (0:45) (0:15) re-enable output buffering, since with sync it is too slow sending every print out when doing a big loop. (we will still need to implement output message optimization, but buffering already helps a lot).

 [x] (1:00) (1:05) terminal paste; still JACKED.  Remove the "paste area" (since it screws up css) and fix paste.

 [x] (1:00) (0:15) terminal copy -- highlight and then it *unhighlights*; is it possible to keep the selection?  Is it possible to just copy instantly without requiring control-c

 [x] (0:30) (1:15) see whether it is possible to set copy buffer from javascript or not... (yet again); if so, don't require control-c in terminal; ANSWER: no, not for now; can partly do using flash and a click (not so useful), or as a Chrome Extension (for later!).

 [x] (0:30) (0:42) I found more cases where paste again doesn't work. fix.  UGH.  It's basically impossible to solve both the copy and paste problems at the same time in a general way... since to copy nicely, you have to be in a mode where paste doesn't work.  I've implemented a copromise, which is that paste when there is a copy selection.  This is not ideal, but is much better than it was.  I'll try something better in the future.

 [x] (0:30) (0:10) make resize use actual top of editor, not computed, in case of title wrap-around.

 [x] (0:30) (1:30) push out new version and post message to list



 [x] (0:30?) (0:12) rename link broken now due to jquery upgrade

 [x] (0:10?) (0:17) remove any uses of "live" from jquery code (jquery upgrade deprecated this).

 [x] (0:30?) (0:08) "RuntimeError: Error: No interact with id 36d22d1a-1af9-45f9-ac6c-3b28834edebd" --> html message "evaluate to create interact"

 [x] install polymake-2.12

 [x] start taking steps to make it easy for users to install own packages locally by installing these
      - pip, virtualenv systemwide.

[x] (0:45) make it so in admin, this is possible... wow, I just spent 30 minutes to discover that I already fully implemented this!
             s.restart('vm', hostname='web1')

 --> [x] (0:30) (0:32) release new version; only need to update web hosts, given the minimal changes so far:
       - updated services file to use new 2013-05-07 image and push to repo
       - create 2013-05-07 image with updates and updated salvus
       - sync base image out
       On storm:
       - stop hub and nginx
       - stop web vm's
       - start web vm's
       - start hub and nginx

import admin; s = admin.Services('conf/deploy_storm/')
s.stop('hub'); s.stop('nginx'); [s.restart("vm", hostname="storm-web%s"%i) for i in range(1,5)]
s._hosts.ping()

       - verify all works
      Then do the same on cloud.

import admin; s = admin.Services('conf/deploy_cloud/')
s.stop('hub'); s.stop('nginx'); [s.restart("vm", hostname="web%s"%i) for i in range(1,5)]
s._hosts.ping()
s.start("hub", wait=False); s.start("nginx", wait=False)

[x] deploy new base vm for users: [s.restart('vm', ip_address='10.1.%s.4'%i) for i in range(1,5)]



 [x] (0:30) (0:10) add google analytics for https://cloud.sagemath.com

 [x] (0:45) (0:11) very bad reproducible CSS/html bug: open two projects in salvus in one browser tab, resize browser, switch back to other project -- screen doesn't resize properly; instead totally1
 corrupted.

 [x] (0:30) the bup snapshots (except on web1) are broken. GREAT :-(; try to do something to fix them.

 [x] (0:15) update web[i] with latest bugfix regarding resize, and with google analytics


    import admin; s = admin.Services('conf/deploy_cloud/')
    s.stop('hub'); s.stop('nginx'); [s.restart("vm", hostname="web%s"%i) for i in range(1,5)]
    s._hosts.ping()
    s.start("hub", wait=False); s.start("nginx", wait=False)


[x] (0:30?) (0:20) change pill thing to have fixed position when editing a file (and non-fixed otherwise); this will get rid of pointless scrollbars, which waste space and throw off calculations.

[x] (0:20?) (0:10) changing pill position got rid of vertical pointless scrollbar, but not horizontal one, when editing. figure out what is causing that.

[x] (0:20?) (0:11) "Recent" files list is position:fixed, but shouldn't be.


[x] (0:30?) (0:10) push out the few ui tweaks without changing the base image (just pull salvus on the web machines and do "make coffee")


[x] (3:00?) Investiage project snapshots ideas: my bup backup approach to snapshoting projects is efficient but is *not* working; the repo gets corrupted, and then nothing works afterwards.  I need to try a few things more carefully (e.g., maybe one repo per project -- less dedup, but much simpler and more robust; ensure saving isn't interrrupted, and if it is delete pack files; ensure only one save at a time -- maybe there is a race/locking issue I'm ignoring?)

New idea for how to make snapshots of projects:

- Have a separate bup rep for each project; all stored in /mnt/backup.  Thus much less dedup, but easier to use and more reliable.
- When a hub is going to create a project snapshot it does the following:
   1. Creates a temporary lock on doing this (using ttl)
   2. Queries database and ensures that it has all the relevant .bup/* files, which are stored in a table in the database.  Any it doesn't have, it grabs from the database to the local /mnt/backup filesystem.
   3. It creates the snapshot and runs fsck -g.
   4. Assuming all is fine, it then copies the *newly* created or modified index files back to Cassandra, which then propogates them to the whole cluster.

Whether or not the above works might depend on how many files are modified.
Also, we would need to somehow reduce the number of files every once in a while
since extract 10000 files from the database would take a long time.

Actually, a simple way to reduce the *number* of files in the database would be to simply use tar to combine
a bunch of the pack files into a single big file.  This avoids having to repack.

So the database entry would contain:

 - about 10 files that store index, etc., are small, and change on every commit.
 - a list (cassandra has a list type now!) of tarballs, each containing a bunch of pack files.

And we have one of the above for each project.  It gets distributed, etc., but all extracted, used, updated on the filesystem by hubs.
Obvious question is how it scales.  How fast?  How much space, etc.

I need a way to make incremental snapshots storing everything about potentially tens of thousands of projects.  They *must* be stored in the database.   I would like to minimize wasted space.

Options:

   - one bup per project --> tarballs, stored in db
   - zfs + dedup + snapshots + fuse (?)
   - incremental tarballs (but that's not even dedup'd)

Two benchmark filesets:
  - the 45MB "my teaching" directory (with two github projects and other misc files); then add salvus github
  - the sage-5.9 binary, then add sage-5.10 binary (measure scalability and dedup).

Benchmark 1:
  - time to create initial archive, starting with 45MB teaching, including "fsck -g"
  - size of initial archive
  - time to update archive after trivially changing one file
  - add salvus github checkout
  - time to create next snapshot
  - size of archive
  - make another copy of the salvus github checkout
  - time to create next snapshot
  - size of archive

If the above is acceptable, then *maybe* Cassandra's own compression will de-dup across projects, somewhat, and we'll be golden.

Benchmark 2:
  - time to create initial archive, starting with sage-5.9
  - size of initial archive
  - time to update archive after trivially changing one file
  - add sage-5.10
  - time to create next snapshot
  - size of archive
  - time to create next snapshot, after trivially changing one file

OK, do it, first with bup using default compression options:

Benchmark 1: 44MB data, using bup with default compression
  - time to create initial archive, starting with 45MB teaching, including "fsck -g": 1.2s (create index), 4.563 (save), 2.511 (fsck)
  - size of initial archive: 16M
  - time to update archive after trivially changing one file: 1.2 (index), 0.340 (save), 0.274 (fsck)
  - add salvus github checkout: new data size 239M;
  - time to create next snapshot:  2.754 (index), 9.92 (save), 44.7 (fsck);
  - size of archive:  archive size is now 196MB.
  - make another copy of the salvus github checkout: data size 435M
  - time to create next snapshot: 2.5 (index), 5.648 (save), 0.398 (fsck)
  - size of archive: 198MB

  Benchmark 1 with "-9":
  - time to create initial archive, starting with 45MB teaching, including "fsck -g": 6.3 (save), 3.5 (fsck)
  - size of initial archive: 15MB
  - time to update archive after trivially changing one file: 1.6 (index), 0.4 (save), .37 (fsck)
  - add salvus github checkout: new data size 239M;
  - time to create next snapshot: 3.3 (index), 24.5s (save), 36s (fsck)
  - size of archive:  archive size is now 195M

  Benchmark 1 with "-0" (no compression):
  - time to create: 6.7 (save), 6.6 (fsck)
  - size: 32MB
  - clone salvus then save: 4.6 (index), 13.9 (save), 39 (fsck)
  - size of archive: 224MB
  - make another copy of salvus, and save again: 4.58s (index), 10s (save), 0.7 fsck
  - time to restore resulting big archive to "foo": 41s

Benchmark 2 (default compression).

time bup index bench1data
time bup save --strip -n bench1 bench1data
time bup fsck -g

  - initial work path size: 3.7GB
  - time to create initial bup archive: 14.7s (index), 4m43s (save), 4m23s (fsck)
  - archive size: 969M (before fsck), 1.1G (after fsck)
  - add second sage-5.10: total data size 7.4G
  - time to save: 44s (index), 3m26s (save), 2m20s (fsck)
  - archive size before second fsck: 1.6G, after: 1.6G
  - time to restore everything:
