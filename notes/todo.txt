Todo list until the next Salvus release
----------------------------------------

  [x] implement the "Sign out" link

  [x] make the contents in the account settings page actually valid

  [ ] saving settings on one client should push changes to all connected clients

  [ ] in demo1.coffee:
          code = system + ".eval(r'''" + code + "''')"  # TODO: this won't work when code contains ''' -- replace by a more sophisticated message to the backend server

  [ ] Make the "forget your password" thing actually submit back to
      the server (just a few lines of code).  

  [ ] Implement URL handler in node for resetting password (this is
      not done).

  [ ] Save x amount of command line history for user on logout and
      periodically Restore on login.

  [ ] Remember me; persistent login cookie. 

  [ ] the function sign_in in hub.coffee needs to have a sign in
      attempt delay like most of the other functions.  Have the delay be 1 s, 2 s, 3s, 5s, 5s, 5s, 5s, ...
 
  [ ] tab completion

  [ ] a worksheet mode

--
  [ ] remove default login creds in account.html
