Todo list until the next Salvus release
----------------------------------------

  [x] implement the "Sign out" link
  [x] make the contents in the account settings page actually valid
  [x] Make the "forget your password" thing actually submit back to
      the server (just a few lines of code).  
  [x] Implement URL handler in node for resetting password (this is
      not done).
  [x] Remember me; persistent login cookie. 
  [x] the function sign_in in hub.coffee needs to have a sign in
      attempt delay like most of the other functions.  Have the delay be 1 s, 2 s, 3s, 5s, 5s, 5s, 5s, ...
 

Very high priority:

  [ ] tab completion

  [ ] a worksheet mode

Lower priority todo:

  [ ]  fix change email gui to use reason object for errors instead of hard coding them.

  [ ] should have an easy link to salvus terms in various places instead of *only* having it on account creation?

  [ ] make error message on sign-in right by the password, not using alert

  [ ] delete account

  [ ] maybe salvus totally broken on ie because of use of console.log ?

  [ ] after remember me is done, I may want to move from key:value
      store to another table so that when user changes their password,
      then all remember_me cookies for them are invalidated.

  [ ] enter to submit: login, change email, etc.

  [ ] saving settings on one client should push changes to all connected clients

  [ ] in demo1.coffee:
          code = system + ".eval(r'''" + code + "''')"  # TODO: this won't work when code contains ''' -- replace by a more sophisticated message to the backend server

  [ ] Save x amount of command line history for user on logout and
      periodically Restore on login.
