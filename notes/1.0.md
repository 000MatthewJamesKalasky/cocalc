# Goals for a 1.0 release that I can charge for

## 10,000 weekly users

## Snapshots:

- at most 2s to display directory listings
- no "missing blob" errors
- auto project redeploy

## User limitations

- project quota: just for safety
- snapshot quota: so my snaps aren't destroyed
- total quota (sum of all project usage).

## Responsive/Mobile support

## 3d graphics based on THREE.js

## Documentation -- all 100% based around cloud.sagemath
- list of what you can do
- tutorial
- book
- sage documentation integrated into cloud.sagemath somehow
- docstring viewer should look nice

## Project sharing

## Publishing content

## Fix serious bugs

- multiple hubs connected to same local hub causes un-fixable sync failure sometimes
- sync'ing doesn't happen
