{"desc":"(1:00?) #today #now\ninvestigate longterm saving projects to google cloud storage via bup or https://github.com/moinakg/pcompress\n\n- Store bup repo of snapshots of project by simply updating, using rsync, and copying any files that might change.\n\n- Also use pcompress (?) to store complete copy of project as a single file, just in case (?).  Incremental based on timestamp (?).\n\n> HSY: except for the encryption (which is orthogonal anyways), this pcompress sounds similar to `lrzip`. It's an \"older\" standard linux utility and hence easily installed via apt-get install lrzip. `lrztar <directory>` and `lrzuntar` are all you need, see `man lrzip`. BTW: it compresses the sage binary tarball 7.6:1 in a few minutes (tried it for the last 6.5 release for ubuntu 14.4), which probably means it is mostly limited by I/O, not CPU.\n\n> William: I think bup is the best choice anyways.  I can't think of anything similarly efficient to solve this problem...\n\n- The current total space used by all bup repos is about 1.3TB, which would cost \\$34/month to store in Google cloud storage. \n\n- I think this isn't a viable approach since compute will often not be a GCE, but this must be at google... (?).\n\nOther ideas to test:\n\nIn each DC have a single global dedup'd compressed ZFS pool with rsync of all projects and also all bups.  It's fine if it is fairly slow. \n\n- Define the dream API I want, then list different ways of implementing it with different backends.\n- I can use that api to save/restore the bup repos to get fine-grained snapshots if I want.\n\nAPI: \n\n        storage save path     # efficiently saves changes to path since last save\n\n        storage restore path  # efficiently restores path from last save.\n\nSolutions:\n\n- rsync to/from a single big volume\n- rsync to/from distributed volumes with a cassandra index\n- rsync to/from gluster (or other cluster) filesystem\n- google cloud storage with incremental tarballs and repack every so often.\n- google cloud storage using bup repos and gsutil rsync\n- many individual persistent disks?!  (massively wasteful)\n- sparse image files stored in google cloud storage\n\nOR... don't change anything but just improve my current implementation to do solve additional problems:\n\n   - disk space running out: rebalance, increase volume size.\n   \nThe ultimate would be:\n\n   - a magic single multi-data-center global distributed filesystem that compute machines can mount, which is super fast.  Involves a local cache.\n   \nTest this:\n\n - glusterfs us in my sagemathcloud project on 3 nodes\n - another glusterfs in europe in my sagemathcloud project on 3 nodes\n - could then make the \"open project on compute\" process first check\n   for cached local files, and if not copy them from the glusterfs.\n   If so, just update them.  With state stored in cassandra (?) or filesystem.\n - then I could delete any projects from compute vm's without any loss in functionality (just speed), which since \n - could also move a project from any vm to another (even in same dc) without loss of files, just speed.\n - would just have to make the \"write to gluster\" operation write to all glusters via an rsync in parallel\n \n \nNone of the above solves any problems really.  Instead I should just improve the current system, which is pretty damn good -- just not finished.  I can decouple compute and storage enough this way. \n\n - add command to move all data for a project from one node to another in the same datacenter\n - make bup_repair properly get results in small batches rather than all at once.\n \n \nOr... the other option, which is:\n\n- In each DC have a single NFS server, and have all compute vm's mount from it over the LAN.\n- It will be a single zfs pool (so can snapshot) -- about 4TB for starters (could try to dedup compute data if possible... if that fails, rebuild without dedup.)\n\nNO.  That centralizes everything, which doesn't scale.  Even now it would barely work at UW.\n\n","position":-6.859375,"last_edited":1424661119535,"task_id":"e9b674f3-a438-473d-aa33-a90d5779005c","done":1424661119126}
