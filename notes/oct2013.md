- [ ] next release:
    - apt-get upgrade
    - new deb packages: haskell-platform haskell-platform-doc haskell-platform-prof  mono-devel mono-tools-devel ocaml ocaml-doc tuareg-mode ocaml-mode libgdbm-dev mlton sshfs sparkleshare dropbox
    x- install SML (requested on google+)
    x- install ocaml
    x- install some haskell thing that's maybe mentioned on github issues (??): haskell-platform
    x - make it so on startup the ssh keys in the /home/salvus/ directory are deleted, since they aren't needed on the compute
       machine, and are dangerous, since they provide access to other things...

    x - rebuild nginx on base machine, and ensure that "-V" doesn't show rewrite module missing!
    - manually login to each compute node and change salvus account password, since
      that password is stored in the external image for each compute machine...

    - start up database with auth enabled (in cassandra)
    - quickly paste in code to add slavus/hub/snap users: see file box/DANGER.txt in laptop
    - start up everything else

    - test storm very hard due to all the `base_url` stuff -- make sure that doesn't break stuff.


- NEXT goal: make it so I can 100% do cloud development in cloud, i.e., make it so my "cloud.sagemath" project
  is a complete running copy of cloud, using some port forward.  Why:
      x- snapshotting
      x- aleviate my limited-memory laptop issues
      x- collab.

    - [x] Ports -- make it possible to customize all of these via services file, in one line at top
        HAPROXY_PORT = 8000
        NGINX_PORT   = 8080
        HUB_PORT       = 5000
        HUB_PROXY_PORT = 5001
        CASSANDRA_CLIENT_PORT = 9160
        CASSANDRA_INTERNODE_PORTS = [7000, 7001]

    - [ ] write dev guide:
         - ssh key setup
         - limitations
         - starting/stopping
         - beware of unused code

    - [x] cassandra is "wide open" -- must implement auth; first do each of these in my devel db,
          then for laptop, then storm, then cloud during next release:

          1. Add this on the [cassandra] line of services (in all of the services files):
   'authenticator':'org.apache.cassandra.auth.PasswordAuthenticator', 'authorizer':'org.apache.cassandra.auth.CassandraAuthorizer'

           - increase replication level of system_auth keyspace (only for cloud and storm) -- run "nodetool repair" on all nodes
             after doing this (done on cloud and storm, and nodetool repair started):

                ALTER KEYSPACE system_auth WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'DC0' : 2, 'DC1' : 2};

           - create 'salvus' superuser, and 'hub', 'snap' users:
           - remove cassandra superuser:
           - grant rights to 'hub' and 'snap' users...

                CREATE USER salvus WITH PASSWORD '<random 16 characters>' SUPERUSER;
                CREATE USER hub WITH PASSWORD '<random 16 characters>';
                CREATE USER snap WITH PASSWORD '<random 16 characters>';
                DROP USER cassandra
                GRANT ALL ON KEYSPACE salvus TO hub;
                GRANT ALL ON KEYSPACE salvus to snap;   /* make more restrictive later once this is done and working */

                cqlsh:salvus> list users;
                 name   | super
                --------+-------
                 salvus |  True
                   snap | False
                    hub | False


           - make 'hub' use its user
           - make 'snap' use its user

       x- Make sure clear docs in cassandra.py about exactly how to set these things up.
       x- Make passwords random 16-character strings in secrets/ directory, and NOT in github.
       x- Make one set for local dev, and a different set for deployed cloud.
