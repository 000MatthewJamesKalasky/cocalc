- [ ] next release:
    - test very hard due to all the `base_url` stuff -- make sure that doesn't break stuff.
    - install SML (requested on google+)
    - install ocaml
    - install some haskell thing that's maybe mentioned on github issues (??)
    - rebuild nginx on base machine, and ensure that "-V" doesn't show rewrite module missing!
    - create accounts: salvus, hub, snap.

- NEXT goal: make it so I can 100% do cloud development in cloud, i.e., make it so my "cloud.sagemath" project
  is a complete running copy of cloud, using some port forward.  Why:
      - snapshoting
      - aleviate my limited-memory laptop issues
      - collab.

    - [ ] cassandra is "wide open" -- must implement auth; first do each of these in my devel db,
          then for laptop, then storm, then cloud during next release:

          1. Add this on the [cassandra] line of services (in all of the services files):
   'authenticator':'org.apache.cassandra.auth.PasswordAuthenticator', 'authorizer':'org.apache.cassandra.auth.CassandraAuthorizer'

           - increase replication level of system_auth keyspace (only for cloud and storm) -- run "nodetool repair" on all nodes
             after doing this (done on cloud and storm, and nodetool repair started):

                ALTER KEYSPACE system_auth WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'DC0' : 2, 'DC1' : 2};

           - create 'salvus' superuser, and 'hub', 'snap' users:

                CREATE USER salvus WITH PASSWORD '<random 16 characters>' SUPERUSER;
                CREATE USER hub WITH PASSWORD '<random 16 characters>';
                CREATE USER snap WITH PASSWORD '<random 16 characters>';

           - remove cassandra superuser:

                DROP USER cassandra

                cqlsh:salvus> list users;
                 name   | super
                --------+-------
                 salvus |  True
                   snap | False
                    hub | False

           - grant rights to 'hub' and 'snap' users...

                GRANT ALL ON KEYSPACE salvus TO hub;
                GRANT ALL ON KEYSPACE salvus to snap;   /* make more restrictive later once this is done and working */

           - make 'hub' use its user


           - make 'snap' use its user

       - Make sure clear docs in cassandra.py about exactly how to set these things up.
       - Make passwords random 16-character strings in secrets/ directory, and NOT in github.
       - Make one set for local dev, and a different set for deployed cloud.

    - [ ] port randomization -- choose n available ports on startup, and assign them all for various things -- low priority at start; e.g., running cassandra and getting access to port: may have to make them custom due to multiple projects on same machine

    - [ ] Ports -- make it possible to customize all of these via services file

        HAPROXY_PORT = 8000
        NGINX_PORT   = 8080
        HUB_PORT       = 5000
        HUB_PROXY_PORT = 5001
        CASSANDRA_CLIENT_PORT = 9160
        CASSANDRA_INTERNODE_PORTS = [7000, 7001]

    - [ ] make it possible to customize all ports in services in one line at the top (then improve that...)

    - [ ] write dev guide:
         - ssh key setup
         - limitations
         - starting/stopping
         - beware of unused code
