CONFIG GOAL for this week's rollout:
-----------------------------------

UW Server room
==============
  geom:
    * geom      -- openvpn server, stunnel, haproxy

  combinat:
    * combinat  -- stunnel, haproxy
    * combinat1  -- memcached, nginx, tornado, postgresql master
    * combinat2  -- memcached, nginx, tornado, postgresql slave
    * combinat3  -- sage server
    * combinat4  -- sage server

Servedby.net
============
    * servedby1 -- vpn server (redundant), stunnel backup, haproxy, memcached, nginx, tornado, postgresql slave
    * servedby2 -- sage server

My Office
=========
    * bsd1 -- stunnel, haproxy, memcached, nginx, tornado, postgresql slave
    * bsd2 -- sage server


-----------------




TODO:

 [x] setup combinat1 to start vpn on reboot
 [x] bsd1 (clone combinat1)
 [x] combinat3 -- configure vpn and hostname
 [x] bsd2 (clone combinat3)
 [x] combinat2 -- configure vpn and hostname
 [x] combinat4 -- configure vpn and hostname

 [x] make sure all vm's prefer google's dns and are in the domain salv.us
dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 
dns-search salv.us 

 [x] bsd1
 [x] combinat1
 [x] combinat2
 [x] combinat3
 [x] combinat4
 [x] bsd2
 
 [ ] ??probably remove the non-vpn local network access to machines -- better
     to use RDP athen turn off. ??





SOON:

 [ ] the sage_server machines needs to have outgoing network
     firewalled massively (don't know how yet)
 [ ] servedby1 will have to listen to outside world but *ONLY* for
     ports 443 and 80, so database is not exposed

LATER:
-------

Redhawk VM's (I need to upgrade OS on Redhawk first...):
 * redhawk -- ??
 * rh1 -- memcached, nginx, tornado, postgresql slave
 * rh2 -- memcached, nginx, tornado
 * rh3 -- sage server
 * rh4 -- sage server

UW Tower (not yet; need to buy hardware -- 2 identical $4K machines: ~ 64GB ram & 32 cores):

 * towera (host) -- openvpn server, stunnel, haproxy
 * towera1 (vm) -- memcached, nginx, tornado, postgresql slave
 * towera2 (vm) -- memcached, nginx, tornado
 * towera3 -- sage server
 * towera4 -- sage server
 * towera5 -- sage server
 * towera6 -- sage server
 * towera7 -- sage server
 * towera8 -- sage server

 * towerb (host)
 * towerb1 (vm) -- memcached, nginx, tornado, postgresql slave
 * towerb2 (vm) -- memcached, nginx, tornado
 * towerb3 -- sage server
 * towerb4 -- sage server
 * towerb5 -- sage server
 * towerb6 -- sage server
 * towerb7 -- sage server
 * towerb8 -- sage server


I consider a sage server VM to be able to handle about 20 simultaneous
sessions... this may just be wrong.  It's a guess, esp. because a lot
depends on what they are doing.  Probably memory is the limiting
factor, actually.  We thus above would have 20*20 = 400 sessions at
*once*.   

What would I need to get 10000 sessions at once?  

Maybe 50 machines, which would cost:
   $200,000 + $1000/month

10000 people at once would be probably a million users, which would at
a $1/each month, would be a lot of money.


VPN:

10.37.0.1  geom
10.37.0.6  combinat
10.37.0.26 salvus0   # laptop control
10.37.0.10 salvus1
10.37.0.14 salvus3
10.37.0.18 salvus5
10.37.0.22 salvus7
10.37.0.30 servedby1
10.37.0.34 servedby2

NOTES:

stunnel --> combinat.math.washington.edu

i.e., stunnel will connect to port 443 on combinat.

combinat will connect via a *secure* openVPN tunnel to everything else.

When combinat goes down, round robbin DNS will take over and clients will
hit another server.


DONE:

 [x] write a script that determines which of the machines in our VPN are connected
