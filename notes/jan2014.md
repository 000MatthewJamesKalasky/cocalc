TODO:

--> - [ ] (0:30?) snap: disable in startup scripts...
 - [ ] (0:45?) CRITICAL- file chat broken by switch; it's an "open before file create" issue; touching file makes it work. Has to do with code for dealing with read-only files that I added.
 - [ ] (1:00?) hub: finish implementing automatic timeout when inactive
 - [ ] (1:00?) a database field to disable project timeouts
 - [ ] console restart often still doesn't work :-(


Sage Days 56:

 - make some use of GCE for sage dev (?)
 - organize bug days
 - triage bugs
 - online homework system
 - ideas for better use of snapshots:
     - tags like git; could be used in url, e.g.,  <https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/af95e67e-809d-49b1-a323-5c7e441b06e5/tags/foobar/>
        - the tag would just be mapped to existing snapshot names; just a simple map in projects table.
        - user wouldn't be allowed to delete snapshot without big fat warning.
     - could have user-wide tags, which point to a specific version of a file/directory in a project:
         <https://cloud.sagemath.com/users/user_id/tags/foobar>
       (or when we have usernames, `user_id --> username`).  If foobar not given, would list all tags for that user.


 - user guidebook
 - marketing campaign ideas
     - blog post ideas
 - business ideas
     - early signup price (like google play): basically only way to get permanent discount
 - brainstorm ideas that are very fast because of using ZFS, e.g., clone/forking/etc.
 - Sage infrastructure discussions.
 - optimize (with Andrew) the file listing script



BUGS:
 - [ ] "open .git" from terminal fails
 - [ ] open often shows wrong tab


DONE:


- [ ] (2:00?) setup working SMC dev environment on vm... unless I run into a show-stopper issue with missing deps
       - [x] update database schema (used "git diff <commit_id> db_schema.cql")
       - [x] create projects zpool locally:
                - [x] shutdown vm
                - [x] add a new 16GB disk image
                - [x] setup compressed and dedup'd as zpool "projects":
                       zpool create -f projects /dev/sdb
                       zfs set dedup=on projects
                       zfs set compression=lz4 projects
                - [x] create storage user with sudo zfs access
                - [x] new script in /usr/local/bin/ (create_project_user.py)

       - [x] get a new project to work there
               - need to add to storage_topology table in db.
                   update storage_topology set vnodes=256 where data_center='0' and host='localhost';
       - [x] "git pull" a copy of my dev code to a new project

- [x] January SMC development log.
---------------------------
I'm on a flight to Hawaii, and I'm not going to get to do any real
SMC development with testing... because I used ZFS on a file on OS X,
and it DIED killing all my vm's when I stupidly (?) hard rebooted my
machine.
  Or NOT.  I couldn't import since they are already imported! Duh.!
  - update my smc plans, ideas, etc. a LOT
  - plan out course grading functionality
