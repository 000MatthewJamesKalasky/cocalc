- [ ] (2:00?) setup working SMC dev environment on vm... unless I run into a show-stopper issue with missing deps
       - [x] update database schema (used "git diff <commit_id> db_schema.cql")
       - [x] create projects zpool locally: 
                - [x] shutdown vm
                - [x] add a new 16GB disk image
                - [x] setup compressed and dedup'd as zpool "projects":
                       zpool create -f projects /dev/sdb  
                       zfs set dedup=on projects
                       zfs set compression=lz4 projects
                - [x] create storage user with sudo zfs access
                - [x] new script in /usr/local/bin/ (create_project_user.py)

    -->   - [ ] get a new project to work there
               - need to add to storage_topology table in db.
                   update storage_topology set vnodes=256 where data_center='0' and host='localhost';
                   

       - [ ] "migrate" a copy of my dev code to a new project



- [x] January SMC development log. 
---------------------------
I'm on a flight to Hawaii, and I'm not going to get to do any real
SMC development with testing... because I used ZFS on a file on OS X,
and it DIED killing all my vm's when I stupidly (?) hard rebooted my 
machine.  
  Or NOT.  I couldn't import since they are already imported! Duh.!
  - update my smc plans, ideas, etc. a LOT
  - plan out course grading functionality
