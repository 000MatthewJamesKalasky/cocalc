- [ ] January SMC development log. 
---------------------------
I'm on a flight to Hawaii, and I'm not going to get to do any real
SMC development with testing... because I used ZFS on a file on OS X,
and it DIED killing all my vm's when I stupidly (?) hard rebooted my 
machine.  

  Or NOT.  I couldn't import since they are already imported! Duh.

  - update my smc plans, ideas, etc. a LOT
  - plan out course grading functionality
