# TOP PRIORITY

- [ ] try setting up a cassandra 2.x cluster from scratch on *bare metal* (/dedicated public ip GCE's there later) with everything SSL encrypted.

- [ ] rewrite database code to not use find -- ugly; doesn't clean up properly...
        debug: execute_code: "find /home/salvus/streams//06049aff-157e-4cf1-9f72-adf1aafcd29e -type f -printf %s %P

- [ ] during the save this sometimes happens (when pushing load hard):  Make it retry with exponential backoff... like the Netflix code does.
    coffee> error: Query cql('UPDATE storage_chunks SET chunk=?, size=? WHERE chunk_id=?',params=[[16,138,14,232,246,161,0,253,95,133,...) caused a CQL error:
    ResponseError: Operation timed out - received only 0 responses.
    s.verbose=1

- [ ] change the "scrub" code to (1) scan everything; (2) wait n minutes (?); (3) then do the delete.  Then it won't delete stuff in progress.
      ALSO, need to rewrite scrub to use paging, since already querying for everything is too slow...
      Alternatively, keep a list of all *possible* blocks in an entry for the given blob *before* starting the save.
      Then if something goes wrong, we have an easy query to know what to clean up.  And scrub will just use that too.
      We never write a chunk unless we have successfully recorded the id's elsewhere.

- [ ] consider just setting up a different cassandra cluster for "storage", to avoid the load overlap. (?)

- [ ] rebooting the GCE nodes seems to never succeed (surely due to ZFS), so just write the command line code to recreate them.

- [ ] that said, run a stress test and figure out what is wrong with the `execute_code` function!

- [ ] admin monitor FAIL:

- [ ] finish first round of migrating projects from -- 3,5,6 (then re-enable for users in database)

- [ ] storage: better schedule for applying streams, which does the right thing when forks happen, multiple start times, etc.  I.e., no matter what even when we don't delete streams.   Basically, we start with the stream with the newest end time, then work back until hitting a stream with 0 interval.   Make *that* the only thing returned by the "def streams" function.

- [ ] storage: trim function that goes through and deletes all (non-fork) streams that would not be applied (except forks)

- [ ] storage: come up with a plan for *how* compute machines will use database + caching of streams sensible... and implement. switch some projects.


# LATER


# UI

- [ ] solid simple GUI editor for %html: https://github.com/guardian/scribe



# DONE

- [x] restore the internal firewalling on compute VM's, namely disallow connections on user ports from anywhere except a
      specific whitelist of external hub VM's.  Right now, it's mainly security by obscurity.
          https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/1448b75264eeda11


- [x] storage.coffee: replicate (as storage user, using storage project)

- [x] official ipython upgrade: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14713    ; running tests in scratch on compute13a


- [x] storage: should I use a database (+local streams cache) in order to separate compute from storage, which will make compute much, much more dynamically scalable?  ANS -- YES

   - [x] (2:00?) (12:00 --yep 12 hours) write code to split (into small pieces) and save (in parallel) a big object to the database and test.
         - I wrote this demo code.
         - When saving in parallel (with many threads) I guess across the C* cluster, it's about the same as rsync/scp, but seems more robust:
               it's about 10MB/s across my encrypted network/vpn.
         - can't load a big file directly into memory -- will have to do something with streaming and chunking (more complicated code)
         - I think this is viable, but as a separate keyspace (for security and to use a different replication factor)
         - This will be the long-term storage of projects.   We can still cache on local disk.  But view that only as a cache.
         -

    CREATE KEYSPACE storage WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'DC0': '2', 'DC1': '2'};
    CREATE USER storage0 WITH PASSWORD='random...';
    GRANT ALL ON KEYSPACE storage TO storage0;



- [x] cassandra -- redo to use ZFS -- e.g., 5,6,7 will save 100's of GB's of space (and we could use it there).

DONE: 1,2,5,6,7,4,3,10,11,12,13,14,15,
TODO: 16,17,18,19,20,21

import admin; reload(admin); cloud = admin.Services('conf/deploy_cloud/'); h = lambda x: cloud._hosts('cassandra%s'%n, x, sudo=True, timeout=3600)
cloud.restart('vm',hostname='cassandra%s'%n)  # may take doing it multiple times...
cloud.wait_until_up('10.1.%s.2'%n)

h('umount /mnt/cassandra')
h('zfs set mountpoint=/mnt/cassandra cassandra')
h('zfs snapshot cassandra@init')
h('zpool export cassandra')

--> Which is the same as log in and...

    # fdisk /dev/vdc
    zpool create -f cassandra /dev/vdc
    zfs set compression=lz4 cassandra
    zfs set atime=off cassandra
    zfs set logbias=throughput cassandra
    time sudo rsync -axH /mnt/cassandra/ /cassandra/
    umount /mnt/cassandra
    zfs set mountpoint=/mnt/cassandra cassandra
    zfs snapshot cassandra@init
    zpool export cassandra


--> remove the old image from services file, then

import admin; reload(admin); cloud = admin.Services('conf/deploy_cloud/'); h = lambda x: cloud._hosts('cassandra%s'%n, x, sudo=True, timeout=3600)

cloud.restart('vm',hostname='cassandra%s'%n)
cloud.wait_until_up('10.1.%s.2'%n)
h('zpool import -f cassandra')
cloud.start('cassandra',host='cassandra%s'%n,wait=True)

print cloud._hosts('cassandra%s'%n, 'cd ~/salvus/salvus; . salvus-env; nodetool status', wait=True)


---> Once it is working, move the cassandra-cassandra.img to TRASH.

---
    Net result for cassandra5 -- it takes up 2.2G on disk instead of 150G :-)

        150G    cassandra5-cassandra.img
        2.2G    cassandra5-cassandra-zfs.img

    And migrating to an encrypted SSD device later will be easy (zfs send/recv).  Plus I can snapshot all nodes for a backup-in-place.
    And I can also make offsites of all nodes via zfs send.

---

- [x] build sage-6.2.beta with ipython update:  git fetch git://git.sagemath.org/sage.git u/ohanar/ipython-upgrade
            use system-wide atlas so it's fast to build and portable.
      - [x] ensure clawpack fully works in new sage version
      - [x] more useful crontab monitoring pools:
            */5 * * * * sudo zpool list projects > /home/storage/.zpool.list.projects && cp /home/storage/.zpool.list.projects /home/storage/zpool.list.projects

            */5 * * * * sudo zpool list cassandra > /home/storage/.zpool.list.cassandra && cp /home/storage/.zpool.list.cassandra /home/storage/zpool.list.cassandra
      - [x] make storage user have more sudo powers:
            # to manage the zfs pool for other projects
            storage ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/zfs *
            storage ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/zpool *

            # to create users for projects
            storage ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/create_project_user.py *
      - [x] automate put latest smc_storage.py in /home/storage/



   - [x] create a new ZFS pool on each compute machine called "storage" with filesystems -- no dedup and no compression.
        storage/images
        storage/streams

        zpool create storage -f /dev/sdc
        zfs set sync=disabled storage
        zfs create storage/images
        zfs create storage/streams
        chown storage. /storage/streams
        chown storage. /storage/images
        chmod og-rwx /storage/streams
        chmod og-rwx /storage/images
        zpool export storage

    (x) done at UW

- [x] create 425GB/each storage devices on all of 3.1.x.4 for x=1,2,..,8, attach and configure (with care!)
      (only 8 remains)

- [x] export and delete storage on 3.1.x.4 for x=1,2,3.
- [x] create zpool image ubuntu-base-salvus-qcow, and copy over data.

- [x] pexpect bug -- fix in base image and update
       /usr/local/sage/sage-6.2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pexpect.py

- [x] transition the 8 compute machines at Google from Debian to Ubuntu:
       - [x] setup compute-base-disk and run doctests
       - [x] worry about startup script and switch 10.3.4.4 first, since no projects are running there.
          - [x] 10.3.4.4
          - [x] 10.3.3.4

 - [x] Make sure to do this: "zfs set sync=disabled storage" on storage1-8 on gce nodes.

- [x] (1:03) fix bug with raw http server failing.

The top of the log for a failed project is:
