---------------------------------------

= UX =
(0:20?)  [x] (0:06) do not delete whitespace on line that contains the cursor (codemirror plugin)
(0:20?)  [x] (0:22) in project file listing search, make it so that the *other* hidden files are not clickable!
(0:45?)  [x] (0:14) cursor replication when sync starts -- might have fixed it -- NOT SURE!
(0:30?)  [x] (0:30) after entering a command in project command line, focus should *stay* on command line.
(1:00?)  [x] (1:55)  create a new file/directory;default filename for terminal and worksheet date/time iso format
(0:30?)  [x] (0:16) the alert message tab thing covers the connection settings.

(0:20?)  [x] (0:40) bug: sometimes clicking the x to close an open file (in file editor pills) just leaves it -- even though counter goes down; then it can't be closed; this is also why sometimes searching the list of open files doesn't work.;   ALSO did more work on new file page (which took most of the time)

(0:30?)  [x] (0:06) project: When changing project title, should auto change the entry in the tab at the top.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:08) editor - the undo buffer should *NOT* start with buffer empty, but with result of loading content!!!

(1:30?)  [x] (0:50) make it so project nav tabs hide when showing editor; make codemirror edit window "FULL SCREEN" always
         [x] (0:36) greatly improve style of top bar due to fullscreening
(0:45?)  [x] (1:30) make worksheet edit window "FULL SCREEN" always; still not so clean!

(0:45?)  [x] (1:43) make terminal edit window "FULL SCREEN" always -- and cleaned up some related things all over, especially proper resizing math.
(0:20?)  [x] (0:17) file selector -- putting slash at end in search should restrict to directories.
(0:20?)  [x] (0:08) create new file by typing a name that results in no hits in file search creates it... with a button to choose type (or cancel)
(1:00?)  [x] (0:59) editors need to have "show" called when window is resized; also, get rid of responsive top bar bullshit and do it right.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:59) idea -- what if we allow opening the same project in multiple tabs -- then get multiple views on same project.  Not good. Instead, usable implementation of files as tabs optionally to try out...
(1:00?)  [x] way to make a new folder
(1:00?)  [x] (1:00) way to rename file
(0:30?)  [x] (0:42) delete/download file icons should only appear on hover; also, added a link for importing files from the web (will use wget)
         [x] (1:10) refactoring and cleanup of file listing code.
(0:45?)  [x] (0:42) way to delete files; just moves to project_path/.trash, making that directory if necessary and printing a message
(0:30?)  [x] (0:30) close all recently opened files.
(1:00?)  [x] (1:13) import files form web using wget --- make it live; add a slider for how long it will try to download until giving up.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:15) way to browse trash can
(0:30?)  [x] (0:36) way to empty trash can
(1:30?)  [x] (0:59) way to move files into a folder by dragging them.
(0:30?)  [x] fix auto-resizing of input cells of worksheet
(0:30?)  [x] (0:40) show hidden files toggle (icon?) -- also fixed misc trash-can related bugs
         [x] (0:09) slight improvements to css of open files
(0:30?)  [x] (0:14) error message when file doesn't load should not be *in* codemirror
(0:30?)  [x] (0:18) need a "save all open files" button somewhere (in editor's list of open files page)
(0:45?)  [x] (0:16) bug -- worksheet tab completion is now broken (actually underneath) worksheets...; also fix vertical resizing as options for worksheet cells
(0:15?)  [x] (0:10) need to save worksheet on creation, so next load has a chance to work.

(0:45?)  [x] (1:06) make it so the little project tab bar is *always* visible, just below the main nav bar.  Will require care about fullscreen size for each.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:27) get rid of code that always switches to recent and vanishes editor on selecting tab -- just leave as is; add "open file/folder" button
(0:20?)  [x] (0:42) list of files in file browser for project needs to be scrollable and have fixed height.
(0:15?)  [x] (0:11) file rename -- should have to click twice to activate?

(0:10?)  [x] (0:15) bug: control-o in editor to get to recent is broken

With the following done, we will have 100% fixed the UI for now:

(0:30?)  [x] (0:45) do not actually open a tab in editor unless the user explicitly selects it.  Make this lazy.  this was we can leave recent as is.

(1:00?)  [x] (0:50) PLAN THIS: each open file *must* corr to a tab in the second line bar. Sorry.  Get rid of the path up there and put a big pull-ed right
             tabbar up.  Shrink to accom. arbitrary many.
(0:30?)  [x] (make project nav area full with

(0:10?)  [x] (0:15) move little upper right path

(0:30?)  [x] (0:30) stacked cursors issue -- local hub should only allow global hub once as a client for given file.
              doubled cursors issue is now fixed.

(1:30?) [x] (0:30)  when visiting a synchronized editing session after a long time (and sync broken), the first few
        characters typed get jumbled.   I'm not going to worry more about this, since it *only* happens if
        the local_hub goes down... and maybe then some loss is inevitable.  This is not something (like user's connection or global hub change)
        that will happen much.
(0:45?) [x] cursor doubling -- this is because the same hub connects twice to the same local_hub and broadcasts to itself.
                Solution: when connecting to local_hub, local_hub should discard all connections from that same hub.
                Could be determined by a self-reported uuid on startup of global hub.
(1:00?)  [x] (0:15) clean up the bar at the top of worksheets; make consistent with files...
         [x] Make background color of worksheets consistent... and easy to change later.
 (0:30?) [x] (0:30) when showing worksheet, need to call refresh on all cells in the worksheet


(0:30?)  [x] (1:05) range selection -- need to also preserve that on sync.  (harder than I thought!)

        [x] (0:22) make the trash can vastly more usable using move's amazing "backup" option; add file list refresh option.

(0:30?)  [x] (1:20) make it so the chat window appears again.
(0:45?) [x] re-enable (and test) automatic timeout of sync sessions in local_hub

 (0:45?)  [x] (0:37) bug in directory download -- need to name things sensibly; may require changes in hubs.


(0:30?) [x] (1:10) download a project, etc.

(0:45?)  [x] (0:13) bug: worksheet -- default path is relative to home directory not project.
(0:15?)  [x] bug -- "Results of searching" needs to be scrollable.

 [x] just did a very quick proof-of-concept of editor pages being tabs... It really just needs polish,  but will work.  need to move... can move.  THIS IS AWESOME!

(0:10?)  [x] make other standard tabs only icons; move search box to search page only
(0:30?)  [x] move editor tab placement to project code and tabs -- each open file is in a project tab; code will need to be refactored.


(0:20?) [x] (0:23) PDF preview is probably not correct height... I'm good at this now.

        [x] (0:12) PDF preview -- easy to make it 2-up? -- at least play for a moment

(0:45?) [x] (0:19) pdf preview doesn't work on ipad -- this is because no security cert yet, so this will go away!.  I figured this out using
            the awesome remote ipad dev console.
(0:30?) [x] (1:00) evaluate button for cells in worksheet.

[x] (1:30) worksheet timers, etc.

 (0:45?) [x] (0:49) project UI: did something like this, but general cleanup instead --  combine the two search pages, with the file search in the right side of page.  (?)


(0:45?)  [x] (1:07) editor buttons: search/replace/undo/redo/autoindent/shift left/shift right; plus tooltips.
(0:30?)  [x] (1:00) buttons in terminal: increase font, decrease font, paste spot, refresh, then title
(0:10?)  [x] (0:14) bug -- save all should only save things that are already open; plus some style cleanup
(0:45?)  [x] (0:43) codemirror split screen editing.  I NEED IT.  Now I gots it.
(0:30?)  [x] (1:22) tabs -- make them shrink as more are added; also fix some serious bug/issues with split editing.
(0:30?)  [x] (0:05) feature -- open new documents on creation.


(1:00?)  [x] (0:28) change filename extensions: ".sage-worksheet", ".sage-terminal", ".sage-cell", ".sage-quiz", ".sage-backup", ".sage-chat", etc.

(0:30?)  [x] (0:05) bug -- can have the same filename twice in recent files if you make new file; e.g., make "a" worksheet twice.
[x] (0:21) make it so one can sort files by time or alphabetical
-
(0:15?)  [x] (0:04) ui bug: when selecting any of the top five things on left, they should get active and nothing else.

(0:30)   [x] (0:23) font size in editor; go to line in editor
(0:30?)  [x] bug: if you start clicking around directories quickly, you can easily get to a nonexistent path due to time of gitls round trip.  So... when that happens display the last valid path; save last working path, and don't change path to a directory that doesn't exist (as determined by an error from git-ls)

[x] (0:08) CSS and styling of terminal.
[x] disabled draggable of recent... since I didn't use it once today!
[x] (0:20) goto line keyboard shortcut; toggle split view shortcut.


(0:08?)  [x] (0:20) pdf preview -- make resolution function of width?
(1:00?)  [x] (3:30) bug -- when reconnecting to a TERMINAL session, it display a bunch of garbage codes.

(0:10?) [x] bug -- add or delete open file pill should result in a resize all (not just on add)

(1:00?)  [x] (0:46) get ssl cert setup for cloud.sagemath.org:

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cloud.sagemath.key -out cloud.sagemath.csr
IO2wMWk7
01salvus: 128.95.224.230
06salvus: 128.95.242.135


(1:00?) [x] (0:16) change any hard coded "salv.us" to cloud.sagemath.org


(0:30?) [x] (1:14) create  script to make new unix_account
2614 in hub.coffee:
create_unix_user_on_random_compute_server = (cb) ->
    cb(false, {host:'localhost', username:'sage0',port:22})


(0:30?) [x] make it so each new project get mapped to unix accounts by default, created using above script.
        [x] new accounts get one new unix_user
(0:30?) [x] ui: make it so account in new project uses the user's default account "by default"


(0:10?) [x] ui: make the "directory listing" spinner moved down and bigger -- half hidden looks silly.


(0:05?) [x] (0:03) error viewing files at message should say for what project.


(0:10?) [x] (0:11) figure out port forward trick for hopping a local_hub? -- thought about it, not so happy; found buggy in process

(0:07?) [x] (0:15) ui -- same keyboard shortcuts for zoom in/out of fonts in codemirror as in terminal; plus some other ui cleanup.

features;
(1:00?)  [x] feature -- (4:00 so far) file upload using thttp://www.dropzonejs.com/; need to accept POST


(0:30?) [x] (0:30) protection from the trivial-to-cause "Terminal with infinite output" control-c ignored problem.

--> (0:45?) [x] (3:00) HUGE BUG -- download project kills everything (confirmed in multiple settings) -- obviously trying to tar /home and running out of RAM.
  Surprisingly, this is caused by a major bug in node.js, which is here and is fixed in a new version:
         https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4700
  So, I guess i have to upgrade node.... which is a good idea anyways. This was a frickin' rabit whole!
(0:15?) [x] bug -- tab/untab of selected text -- I assumed direction of selection is one way, but if it is backwards, then bOOM.
(0:45?) [x] HUGE BUG -- (0:16) restarting sage session bug

(0:15?) [x] tiny bug -- when first opening a session the save button should say that there are no unsaved changes...; very confusing otherwise.; this isn't optimal, but at least it tells us if *we* made any changes... for what it is worth.  Optimal would be to know if anybody has.

(1:00?) [x] worksheet filename save

(0:10?) [x]worksheet; no save button; make save every 15 seconds no matter what.


--> (0:45?) [x] editor bug -- weird bug when starting to edit a file and loose something
            -- idea: instead of reseting sync session, just start it from scratch;
               should work, since this problem doesn't happen when freshly connecting!
