- [ ] NEW release
   - [x] modify /etc/and.priorities  # or whatever it is called
   - [x] apt-get install libav-tools
   - [x] sudo apt-get install nmon    # suggested by Harald Schilly
   - [x] add this to root's crontab:
               */1 * * * * killall minerd

# Nov 11: 10am - 10pm, except 1 hour for heating people and 1 hour for eating... so 10 hours.

--> - [ ] (1:00?) re-fix base VM; test/debug on storm:
    - startup/restart of projects on storm is incredibly slow:
       - [ ] 1. make sure that when (re-)starting a project server,
                no coffeescript needs to get compiled, by doing
                that when the hub starts (and also as part
                of the usual process)


- [ ] (0:10?) upgrade hosts (seems safe)
- [ ] (0:45?) make connection info display a modal on click instead of hover text
- [ ] (1:00?) move tinc conf to a different image, so that vm's startup much more quickly.

- [ ] (1:00?) fix latex preview issue -- my change to the get_blob function breaks everything -- need to figure out what is going by testing on storm, then push out update carefully.

- [ ] (1:00?) snap: restarting host of the snap server corrupts some pack files with high probability, breaking everything.  What happens is that there are empty pack files on resume, and for some reason the rollback file doesn't deal with this.  In all cases, removing the empty pack file and moving the head back one commit worked file.

- [ ] (0:30?) restore: store all past locations
- [ ] (1:00?) restore: change to use same account name, if possible.
- [ ] (1:30?) restore: choose new machine with lowest load that is up.
- [ ] (1:00?) restore: if a snapshot fails for some reason, try next older snapshot until success.  Give progress message.
- [ ] (2:00?) restore: status/progress messages to client

---

- [ ] (2:30?) notion of "admin" accounts on SMC with access to system monitor data, and page to show it.


---
- [ ] (0:30?) block outgoing email: (Keith Clawson)
            iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
- [ ] (0:45?) make it so *old* sws's can be converted: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/142393e15d4a9784
- [ ] (0:45?) harald's number of projects query: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/14238c307ccee599
- [ ] (0:45?) redo base VM: current one not working (?)



## High availability



## Impose limitations

 - [ ] use cgroups to limit memory of each project
 - [ ] use cgroups to limit cpu of each project
 - [ ] quotas again - say 10gb?
 - [ ] limit number of projects per user (but make big -- just to avoid crazy cases).
 - [ ] move the /mnt/snap backup scripts into salvus/salvus/scripts/
 - [ ] upgraded to three.js r62 -- https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/commit/10e1fa9d2141cefe7886f4e50b4654160d6e877e
 - [ ] make password reset use different javascript/html that is less subject to issues...
 - [ ] (0:45?) fix storm cassandra database


# Startup optimization:
 - [ ] squash base vm: I think this is making startup very slow, esp in parallel -- it adds a solid 12 seconds?
 - [ ] change the tinc/vpn info to be on a separate tiny .img that can be created instantly.


# Snap: idea for optimization
      - [ ] (0:45?) restore: test to see if restoring via sshfs is better than restoring locally, then using rsync -- no idea.










OLD
====================


- [x] (0:05?) add keith to GCE account
- [x] (0:15?) (1:15) harald animation embed thing: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#search/harald+animation/142351aee45ed9b7
- [x] (1:00?) SMC email
- [x] (0:15?) (0:10) monitoring: write minimal functionality needed for the "move button" -- i.e., in admin.py make the monitor put the last entry into another table too:
    select day, hour, minute, compute from monitor_last where dummy=true;


 - [x] I need a new backups strategy:
        2.9T  2.7T   73G  98% /home/salvus

# TODO:

- [ ] CGROUPS?  Goal -- limit cpu usage of specific projects...?

    http://tuxion.com/2009/10/13/ubuntu-resource-managment-simple-example.html

Crucial: All the examples online are missing the "-t" option, but is *crucial* in modern ubuntu.

    root@ubuntu:/home/wstein# cgcreate -t wstein:wstein -a wstein:wstein -g memory,cpu:wstein3

- [ ] (2:00?) snap: many repos are corrupt, due to master pointing to something that isn't in repo.
        these can all (?) be repaired by simply pointing master to the previous id as listed in logs/HEAD.
        I must systematically run such repair on all the bup repos, since without this, the corresponding
        repos are completely useless.

- [ ] (1:00?) fix image load database issue: https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/61

- [ ] (0:45?) SMC: message if you're using old browser: IE <= 8, etc. -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/59
- [ ] (2:00?) SMC: mathematica in the cloud -- fix bug in sage (?) -- http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13892

- [ ] containers:

# LXC: <https://help.ubuntu.com/13.10/serverguide/lxc.html>

    # first try
    time sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n test1

    # bind wstein

- [ ] (0:15?) worksheet load spinner doesn't spin
- [ ] (1:30?) if document to open is large, provide options.
- [ ] (0:45?) block parser -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/46





---

 - [x] broken blob getting from db.... (image loading)


- [x] ipython hangs.

Tried ipython 2 (tip from github) -- no better at the hang problem.  However, the new support for arbitrary directories and getting rid of id's is awesome.  I really must switch to this, since it will mean only one ipython across all, which saves some time.

Trying to just reconnect the websocket periodically.

    f = window.frames[$("iframe")[0].id]
    setInterval(function(){f.IPython.notebook.kernel.start_channels()}, 10000)




cd salvus/salvus/; sleep $(($RANDOM%5)); ./pull_from_dev_project; . salvus-env; ./make_coffee --all

DONE:

[x] new release on Nov 1:


   - open: There is a new open command, like in OS X.  Just type "open file1 file2 ..." in a full terminal to pop open those files in the editor; this is very preliminary, but may be useful.  (Note that it does not work under tmux yet, and is a little flaky.)

   - OS X friendly terminal changes:
          -- let browser have the command (=meta) key on OS X. (requested by Aron Ahmadia)
          -- make it so "Control+c" works even when text is selected on mac.  (requested by Aron Ahmadia)

   - Refresh buttons: add them to the project list and server stats (on help page).

   - Cassandra database: now uses Java 7 (instead of 6)

   - Snapshots: rewrote snapshot server code to be much more robust; also snapshot do not cross filesystem boundaries (needed to support sshfs remote mounting of filesystems)

   - HAProxy: increased a timeout parameter, which eliminates a bunch of 504 errors, which were causing sporadic trouble with ipython, file download, proxied sessions, etc.

   - IPython sync: numerous improvements and bug fixes related to startup, sync, etc.;  It might be usable again now.

   - Rewrote how most javascript/html gets loaded on upgrades (with a different filename), to decrease issues with browser caching.

   - Fix a leak that would result in a file becoming inaccessible if it is opened too many times (requiring a project server restart).

   - Upgrade to Codemirror Version 3.19

---


 - [x] code to automatically fix snapshot archives that loose the HEAD ref
 - [x] simple python script that goes through and fixes all existing archives:
                active broken on 7 and 12
 - [x] snap: remove non-fixable irrelevant repos:
           11,14,15,16
 - [x] (0:27) snap: if a repo exceeds 30GB, then make a new one. -- that seems like a good rule. -- and roll this out!
 - [x] upgrade host machines


--


 - [x] snap: fix so that repos don't break again (if indeed they ever do again -- wait for evidence)
      web5 and web12 broken last night
      x web13 is OLD?
           fatal: Unable to create '/mnt/snap/snap0/bup/ffeb32c5-1447-4e29-9857-305bde123fb1/refs/heads/master.lock': File exists.
           Problem was caused because refs/heads/master.lock didn't get removed as part of a rollback, since I didn't code that up!
      - [x] (0:15?) (0:36) snap: remove refs/heads/master.lock if it is there
      - [x] (0:45?) (0:45) snap: rollback -- check that bup ls works, and if not, rollback to the *previous* logged refs/heads/master, then check, etc.
      - [x] (0:20?) (0:45) store UTC time in commit database entries.

  alter table snap_commits add utc_seconds_epoch int;

 - [x] (0:05) snap: only broken repo left (?) -- fix or delete from db
      web5 38bcdad6-4c29-4185-a4bc-9292cdd7c795
 - [x] (0:24) get storm to start

 - [x] (0:16) fix storm database: -- it had replication 1, 1
         cqlsh> ALTER KEYSPACE "salvus" WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'DC0':3, 'DC1':3};
         $ nodetool describering salvus>a   # confirms replication change

REMEMBER: setw synchronize-panes

 - [x] this account was running minerd: 3qHhHwPS@10.1.20.4 -- filip.stefanovski@aol.com, account_id=9bf8d35c-2569-4625-995a-6b83246213a0
 - [x] (0:10?) add "no bitcoin mining" to Terms of Usage
 - [x] (0:30?) add python function to get project id


- [x] database status monitoring:
     create user monitor with password '...';
     grant all on table monitor to monitor;
     grant all on table monitor_last to monitor;
 - [x] document my daily "status checks" on the SMC cluster:

          - [x] disk space on compute servers

ssh 10.1.1.4 "df -h /mnt/home"   # etc.
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vdb1      1008G  204G  754G  22% /mnt/home

          - [x] "uptime" on all project servers, web hosts, cassandra

salvus@cloud1:~$ ssh 10.1.1.4 "uptime"
06:38:41 up 8 days,  1:03,  0 users,  load average: 0.96, 0.76, 0.45

          - [x] dns check on compute nodes: host -v github.com

There is a script called "a" on the nodes which does this 30 times:

     host -v trac.sagemath.org >/dev/null && host -v www.sagemath.org >/dev/null; echo $?

It should complete with no errors in under 2 seconds.

          - [x] Make sure there all current snap repos are not corrupted:

# on each one, and this should take at most 2 seconds, and have size <= 35000000
ssh 10.1.11.3 'cd /mnt/snap/snap0/bup/`cat /mnt/snap/snap0/bup/active`&&time BUP_DIR=. bup ls && du -s .'

         - [x] nodetool status and make sure everything up

    # run on one node only!
    ssh 10.1.4.2 "cd salvus/salvus; . salvus-env; nodetool status"
