- [x] ipython hangs.

Tried ipython 2 (tip from github) -- no better at the hang problem.  However, the new support for arbitrary directories and getting rid of id's is awesome.  I really must switch to this, since it will mean only one ipython across all, which saves some time.

Trying to just reconnect the websocket periodically.

    f = window.frames[$("iframe")[0].id]
    setInterval(function(){f.IPython.notebook.kernel.start_channels()}, 10000)




cd salvus/salvus/; sleep $(($RANDOM%5)); ./pull_from_dev_project; . salvus-env; ./make_coffee --all

DONE:

[x] new release on Nov 1:


   - open: There is a new open command, like in OS X.  Just type "open file1 file2 ..." in a full terminal to pop open those files in the editor; this is very preliminary, but may be useful.  (Note that it does not work under tmux yet, and is a little flaky.)

   - OS X friendly terminal changes:
          -- let browser have the command (=meta) key on OS X. (requested by Aron Ahmadia)
          -- make it so "Control+c" works even when text is selected on mac.  (requested by Aron Ahmadia)

   - Refresh buttons: add them to the project list and server stats (on help page).

   - Cassandra database: now uses Java 7 (instead of 6)

   - Snapshots: rewrote snapshot server code to be much more robust; also snapshot do not cross filesystem boundaries (needed to support sshfs remote mounting of filesystems)

   - HAProxy: increased a timeout parameter, which eliminates a bunch of 504 errors, which were causing sporadic trouble with ipython, file download, proxied sessions, etc.

   - IPython sync: numerous improvements and bug fixes related to startup, sync, etc.;  It might be usable again now.

   - Rewrote how most javascript/html gets loaded on upgrades (with a different filename), to decrease issues with browser caching.

   - Fix a leak that would result in a file becoming inaccessible if it is opened too many times (requiring a project server restart).

   - Upgrade to Codemirror Version 3.19
