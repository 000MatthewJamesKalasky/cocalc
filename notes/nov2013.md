- [ ] NEW release
   - [ ] modify /etc/and.priorities  # or whatever it is called

# Nov 6 -7

                active broken on 7 and 12
    - [ ] modify snap so that things don't break

 - [ ] use cgroups to limit cpu of each project
 - [ ] use cgroups to limit memory of each project
 - [ ] restoring projects from snap *robustly*:
          - use same account name, if possible.
          - status/progress messages
          - if a snapshot fails, try next older snapshot
 - [ ] *moving* projects using rsync
 - [ ] upgrade host nodes

# TODO:

- [ ] CGROUPS?  Goal -- limit cpu usage of specific projects...?

    http://tuxion.com/2009/10/13/ubuntu-resource-managment-simple-example.html

Crucial: All the examples online are missing the "-t" option, but is *crucial* in modern ubuntu.

    root@ubuntu:/home/wstein# cgcreate -t wstein:wstein -a wstein:wstein -g memory,cpu:wstein3

- [ ] (2:00?) snap: many repos are corrupt, due to master pointing to something that isn't in repo.
        these can all (?) be repaired by simply pointing master to the previous id as listed in logs/HEAD.
        I must systematically run such repair on all the bup repos, since without this, the corresponding
        repos are completely useless.

- [ ] (1:00?) fix image load database issue: https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/61

- [ ] (0:45?) SMC: message if you're using old browser: IE <= 8, etc. -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/59
- [ ] (2:00?) SMC: mathematica in the cloud -- fix bug in sage (?) -- http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13892

- [ ] containers:

# LXC: <https://help.ubuntu.com/13.10/serverguide/lxc.html>

    # first try
    time sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n test1

    # bind wstein
    time sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n test3 -- -b wstein

# Google LMCTFY: <https://github.com/google/lmctfy>

    time sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu-cloud -n test4 -- -b wstein

# Google LMCTFY: <https://github.com/google/lmctfy>

# Google LMCTFY: <https://github.com/google/lmctfy>

- [ ] (0:15?) worksheet load spinner doesn't spin
- [ ] (1:30?) if document to open is large, provide options.
- [ ] (0:45?) block parser -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/46

- [x] ipython hangs.

Tried ipython 2 (tip from github) -- no better at the hang problem.  However, the new support for arbitrary directories and getting rid of id's is awesome.  I really must switch to this, since it will mean only one ipython across all, which saves some time.

Trying to just reconnect the websocket periodically.

    f = window.frames[$("iframe")[0].id]
    setInterval(function(){f.IPython.notebook.kernel.start_channels()}, 10000)




cd salvus/salvus/; sleep $(($RANDOM%5)); ./pull_from_dev_project; . salvus-env; ./make_coffee --all

DONE:

[x] new release on Nov 1:


   - open: There is a new open command, like in OS X.  Just type "open file1 file2 ..." in a full terminal to pop open those files in the editor; this is very preliminary, but may be useful.  (Note that it does not work under tmux yet, and is a little flaky.)

   - OS X friendly terminal changes:
          -- let browser have the command (=meta) key on OS X. (requested by Aron Ahmadia)
          -- make it so "Control+c" works even when text is selected on mac.  (requested by Aron Ahmadia)

   - Refresh buttons: add them to the project list and server stats (on help page).

   - Cassandra database: now uses Java 7 (instead of 6)

   - Snapshots: rewrote snapshot server code to be much more robust; also snapshot do not cross filesystem boundaries (needed to support sshfs remote mounting of filesystems)

   - HAProxy: increased a timeout parameter, which eliminates a bunch of 504 errors, which were causing sporadic trouble with ipython, file download, proxied sessions, etc.

   - IPython sync: numerous improvements and bug fixes related to startup, sync, etc.;  It might be usable again now.

   - Rewrote how most javascript/html gets loaded on upgrades (with a different filename), to decrease issues with browser caching.

   - Fix a leak that would result in a file becoming inaccessible if it is opened too many times (requiring a project server restart).

   - Upgrade to Codemirror Version 3.19
