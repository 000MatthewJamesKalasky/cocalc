[ ] new release on Nov 1:

User-visible changes:

   - open: There is a new open command, like in OS X.  Just type "open file1 file2 ..." in a full terminal to pop open those files in the editor; this is very preliminary, but may be useful.  (Note that it does not work under tmux yet, and is a little flaky.)

   - OS X friendly terminal changes:
          -- let browser have the command (=meta) key on OS X. (requested by Aron Ahmadia)
          -- make it so "Control+c" works even when text is selected on mac.  (requested by Aron Ahmadia)

   - Refresh buttons: add them to the project list and server stats (on help page).

   - Cassandra database: now uses Java 7 (instead of 6)

   - Snapshots: rewrote snapshot server code to be much more robust; also snapshot system now does not cross filesystem boundaries, which is needed to support sshfs sensibly.

   - HAProxy: increased a timeout parameter (from 7s to 45000s), which eliminates a bunch of 504 errors, which were causing all kinds of sporadic trouble with ipython, file download, proxied sessions breaking, etc. 

   - Rewrote how most javascript/html gets loaded on upgrades (with a different filename), to decrease issues with browser caching.

   - Fix a leak that would result in a file becoming inaccessible if it is opened too many times (requiring a project server restart).

   - Upgrade to Codemirror Version 3.19

   - IPython sync -- numerous improvements and bug fixes related to startup, sync, etc.;
