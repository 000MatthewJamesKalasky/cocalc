Print worksheets with embedded 3d graphics.  Pan with alt/command.  Plots persist between refreshes.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must refresh your browser *and* restart your project's server  (automatic for most projects, which timeout after 3 hours).  If you don't restart the project server, printing of worksheets will be broken.\n\nMore details:\n\n- If you print a worksheet with 3d images, they will be displayed in the pdf in exactly the orientation you left them. \n\n- You can now zoom using shift/control+mouse, and pan using option/command+mouse. \n\n- 3d images properly display when you edit the worksheet in split mode (filmstrip icon), where you can see two points in the worksheet at once. \n\n- When you re-open a worksheet, you'll see all the 3d images immediately; no need to re-evaluate each cell. \n\n- 3d plots only spin when they are in focus. \n\n- 3d points are round and stay constant size on zoom.\n\n- You can now customize the frame. For example:   show(sphere(), frame={'zmax':4, 'fontsize':20,'thickness':3, 'color':'purple'})\n\n- When you zoom in and out, axes labels and other text stay constant size.\n\n","position":-181.99697961473638,"last_edited":1411143871566,"task_id":"01ec92d7-9057-4695-8d50-4cd3205a0aa5","done":1411143871147}
