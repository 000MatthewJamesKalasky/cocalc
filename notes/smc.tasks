Get this data by querying the database when first requested for everything, then storing the complete result in a cache in the DB.   Also, if a project title/email address is changed today add that to a table with a short ttl, so it can also be queried regularly. \n- ui to do actions that one does through admin.py:\n   - start a monitor running on a given machine\n   - get status of service\n   - run command on given collection of machines\n   - restart service somewhere","position":-181.9969453662634,"last_edited":1404624417127,"task_id":"f6971412-c872-4b84-9daf-8c703ae1c358","done":1404624416711}

{"desc":"#today #syncstring\nimplement database-backed synchronized strings\n\n# Ideas\n## Idea 1\nThe idea is to store the entire string as a row in the database so the schema is\n\n    CREATE TABLE sync_strings (\n        string_id  uuid,\n   \t\tmodified   timestamp,\n        string     string,\n        PRIMARY KEY (string_id, modified)\n    );\n\n    \nWe query the db like this periodically:\n\n    SELECT string_id from sync_strings_modified where string_id in (...) and modified >= last_time;\n\nand for each string_id in the result, we do a \"sync with the database\".\n\nThe **HARD PROBLEM** is to figure out what \"sync with the database\" means, since it is just one single static string and sync requires more state.\n\n- Store in memory the value of the string from db last time we did a sync with it.\n- Then compute patch that transforms last into live.\n- Then apply that patch to upstream.\n- Verify any conditions, e.g., well-formed json.\n- Set our live to the result of applying that patch.\n- Set upstream version in db to what we just made and update timestamp.\n\n---\n\nGiven the eventually consistent nature of Cassandra, I don't think the above is an option.\nLoosing notifications wouldn't be so bad, BUT I'll end up using the functionality for much more.\nHmm.\n\n\n## Idea 2 -- Second approach. Schema like this:\n\n\n    CREATE TABLE synchronized_strings (\n        string_id  uuid,\n   \t\thostname   varchar,\n        port       int,\n        secret     varchar,\n        string     string,\n        PRIMARY KEY (uuid)\n    );\n\nWhere the hostname,port,secret are for a hub, which is responsible for being the coordinator\nfor this synchronized string.\n\nWhen a hub wants to use the syncstring, it look up the hostname/port/secret in the\ndb, then connects to that hub.  If connecting fails, then it takes over.  If connecting\nsucceeds, then it works.  If that hub doesn't currently host the string, it'll respond\nso and this new client takes over.\n\nIt seems like there are many ways this could go wrong when there are network partitions.\n\n---\n\n## Idea 3\nI'm considering the first idea again, but a little different.  Instead of a timestamp, use a hash:\n\n    CREATE TABLE sync_strings (\n        string_id  uuid,\n   \t\thash       uuid,       # sha-1 hash of string\n        string     string,\n        PRIMARY KEY string_id\n    );\n\nFor each string the hub is managing at the moment, we select it's hash. \n\n    SELECT string_id, hash from sync_strings where string_id in (...);\n\nFor each hash that has changed, we get the actual strings.\n\n    SELECT string_id, string from sync_strings where string_id in (...);\n\nFor those, we just 100% view this as the \"live\" has changed for one extra client (the database),\nso we just tell all clients to do a sync.  The way that works is exactly like normal, except\nlive in one client is always by definition \"whatever we read from the database\".\n\nHere's a diagram:\n\n     [dc0 database state] .... [dc1 database state] <-----> [*hub*] <---> clients...\n            /|\\\n             |-----[hub] <--> clients...\n\nThis hub views it's in-memory current state of the string as the ultimate\nupstream for the string.  It views the database as one single downstream client,\nand some connected browser clients as other downstream clients.\nWe query the database to see if any hashes have changed. with one single\nquery for *all* strings, so polling scales.\n\nSo what happens in all the bad cases?\n\nIs it eventually consistent?   Yep. \n\nCoding this should be fairly easy (about 2-3 hours).  Let's do it.\nThe value will be very significant.  \n\nCONCERN: if the string is big, a lot of data goes back and forth to the db for no good reason.\n\nSOLUTION:  instead, store this:\n\n    CREATE TABLE sync_strings (\n        string_id  uuid,\n   \t\thash       uuid,       # sha-1 hash of true value\n        string0  string,\n        patches  list<string>,\n        PRIMARY KEY string_id\n    );\n    \nwhere the patches go from string0 to the true value of the string.\nThen by simply appending to the patches list and updating string0, we\ncan ensure that all clients efficiently can track the string, even if\nit is big.  \n\nIf we want, we could also keep the revision history.  I don't know if that\nis a good idea.  \n\nWe can also flatten periodically, which would require all clients to do \nthe same. \n\nThis seems so frickin' awesome; it seems way too good to be true.  It'll make\nimplementing tons of more global -- across projects and users -- stuff ridiculously\neasy in comparison to the current situation. \n\n# Implementation Plan:\n\n- [x] (0:05?)

{"desc":"#marketing\nlanding page\n\nIdeas -- Theron Hitchman's 7 reasons to use SMC when teaching a course:\n\n    \"1. NO install. its a huge deal.\n\n    2. NO maintenance. SMC is kept up to date for you. Basically, +William Stein becomes your IT department, with help from UW and Google.\n\n    3. SMC is really a web app. You can work on your project from any machine. If a student has to work on more than one computer, this is very helpful. In fact, I can work on stuff at home, and SMC stuff is waiting for me when I use the machine in my classroom.\n\n    4. Collaboration tools built in. shared projects, public projects/folders/worksheets/files, chat system. New notification system, too. (just updated today)\n\n    5. automatic back-ups. Lots of them. time-stamped. No \"dog ate my homework\" type troubles. \n\n    6. The new \"course\" features are nice. you can create a foo.course file and use it to distribute assignments automatically to all of your students' projects. Later you can press a single button to collect them all. then you can grade and return the feedback with another single button. The basics here are great, and with more use the user interface will improve.\n\n    7. not just sage! each project is really a virtual machine running a recent version of Ubuntu linux, and it has lots of other software installed that you might find useful. It even lets you use the terminal. I have used SMC for these things: task lists, markdown editing, LaTeX editing with interactive preview, html/css editing, Python scripts, Haskell scripts, web development with Jekyll (built on Ruby), git version control. There are tons of other things I haven't used, but I know are there. C, Cython, Julia, iPython, Fortran, vim, emacs...\n\n    The last point is likely not so important for basic student use, but I really like it. It has become my entry point into becoming a better, more flexible user of a true all-purpose computer. For teaching, I really need only 1-6. But I like to roll my own web pages, and I have started trying to learn about programming, so 7 matters to me.\"\n","position":-69.54774983723959,"last_edited":1417297699202,"task_id":"b102efc5-d45e-4f55-8a02-9ecc9d081877"}

If the string is a few megabytes, this is potentially 100% locking hard on the CPU for a minute!\n\nAn example that causes this is this for a at all big:\n\n\td=new Date(); p=require('diffsync').dmp.diff_compute_(('X'+a).slice(0,a.length),a);new Date() - d\n    \n    \nThis is a MASSIVE issue.  It means that editing a 2MB file (say) could easily result in a browser locking for a minute to compute a diff, if user somehow were to change document just write.  SCARY. \n\nI think the Diff_Timeout option is broken in dmp as implemented.\nIt is always easy to compute *some* patch that transforms one string to another quickly, by simply making the trivial crappy patch.  It sucks, but it works.   So I need to make a patch_make function that has bounded complexity.  I'm OK for my application with it creating horrible patches sometimes, I think.\n\n\nAnother test case:\n\n\n\t dmp = new (require('dmp').diff_match_patch)(); dmp.Diff_Timeout=0.1; a = 'asldkjflasdjflasdjflasjdflasjdfkljas'; a += a; a += a; a += a; a+=a; a+=a; a+=a; a+=a; a+=a; a+=a;a+=a;a+=a;a+=a; a.length; d=new Date(); p=dmp.patch_make(('X'+a).slice(0,a.length),a);0;new Date() - d\n     \nI rewrote diff_match_patch to timeout properly: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/14a12852aa778956\n\nStill need to figure out how I'm going to make that live, etc. And switch to using this systematically...\n\n\nSOLUTION done -- rewrite dmp and use it.
