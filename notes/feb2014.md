# February 2014 -- these are my goals:

--> - [ ] (0:45?) add to my normal monitoring script that every ip address that cloud.sagemath.com maps to actually responds when directly connected to.

- [ ] (1:00?) implement new ZFS backup, which just dumps the whole project (never diffs) to a very compressed file, if it has changed.   Store in a big directory.  Inconsistent histories -- keep both versions.
- [ ] (0:45?) fix this printing issue -- https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/14367e63a3fa1052
- [ ] (1:30?) storage: zfs quota reporting; fix, make much more visible, etc. -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/78
- [ ] (1:30?) add a "always confirm on page close" setting
- [ ] (1:30?) truncate large output in worksheets
- [ ] (1:30?) SMC in SMC -- get it working again
- [ ] (1:00?) switch to route 53 dns
- [ ] (1:00?) close_stale_projects is deciding what is closed/open based on location, which doesn't get reset on close, so it does WAY too many closes
- [ ] (1:00?) re-automate "nodetool cleanup"
- [ ] (1:30?) automate "zpool scrub" -- code in storage.coffee (?)
      - should do "zpool status" on each machine in parallel
      - parse output to seen when last scrub was successful or if there are errors
      - if output indicates any errors, notify me
      - if it was one week ago or more, do another scrub

- [ ] (4:00?) implement cgroups controls on projects
- [ ] (3:00?) project move (dialog to provide info about targets).
- [ ] (3:00?) bug: fuse (and nodejs) is now broken for some users. UGH. -- this is because of BIG uid's....
      Idea to fix this:
          - figure out what the uid cutoff is in both npm and fuse; it's probably the same and fairly universal.
          - figure out the uid's of all existing projects; how many exceed the cutoff?
          - fix the ones that exceed the cutoff, somehow.
          - for the ones that don't leave 'em.
          - store the account uid in the projects database; changing code of create_project_user to take uid as non-optional input.
          - when creating a new project, choose a random uid, check if it is in use, and if not grab it, then check again (to avoid race).
- [ ] (2:00?) properly renaming files -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/4
- [ ] (2:00?) properly deleting files -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/36
- [ ] (2:00?) proper worksheet restarting, with much better ui and actually working!
- [ ] (1:00?) inverted hashtag selection -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/88
- [ ] (3:00?) 2FA -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/85
- [ ] (1:00?) latex escape mode for worksheet printing -- https://github.com/sagemath/cloud/issues/82
- [ ] (2:00?) upgrade to sage-6.1

- [ ] (2:00?) zfs replication: several errors that aren't getting sorted out.  RESOLVE.

- [ ] quota watch:
        94a3a0b8-0257-43ef-9986-89d7fc789a72 -- a bunch of texing, but has used 5GB in *snapshots*.

        e51a48b0-8b47-4d20-ac2d-e9aa7a4462ba
- [ ] (1:30?) update fontawesome: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/wiki/Upgrading-from-3.2.1-to-4
- [ ] (1:30?) update coffeescript: http://ihackernews.com/comments/7139175
- [ ] (1:30?) update node.js
- [ ] (1:30?) update node.js proxy library, and see if it solves this -- res isn't even defined in
        /home/salvus/salvus/salvus/node_modules/http-proxy/lib/http-proxy/passes/ws-incoming.js
      so it is a bug in the proxy library.  DANG.   Check on upstream.  For today, just edit manually.
      I just *temporarily* commented out the whole emit line, since "emit is not defined".
- [ ] (5:00?) upgrade to bootstrap 3: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17974998/updating-bootstrap-to-version-3-what-do-i-have-to-do
- [ ] (2:00?) storage: write code to scan and find all projects that are within 90% of running out of space.
- [ ] (3:00?) copy: enhance copy functionality to send/recv a file to/from all linked projects via a command line function for now
- [ ] (1:30?) fix franco's security issue: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#search/franco/143ca2f6db753e56
- [ ] (1:00?) upgrade to jquery 2.1 -- http://blog.jquery.com/2014/01/24/jquery-1-11-and-2-1-released/
- [ ] (1:00?) ensure rebooting and/or restarting the cassandra nodes works; maybe have to put some zpool import functionality in admin/startup script.
- [ ] (1:30?) upgrade sockjs, which has seen new development: https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/commits/master
- [ ] (2:00?) storage: edge case replication loop -- in this case 10.1.12.4 gets deleted one time, then 10.1.14.4 overwrites it in stage 2, ad infinitum.
        project_id: 306cce9f-fa4a-481b-93ef-afd69a7fb5b4
        current location: 10.3.3.4
        usage: {"avail":"4.97G","used":"26.9M","usedsnap":"8.03M"}
        last_replication_error: {"error":{"src-10.1.14.4-dest-10.1.12.4":"problem -- destination has snapshots that the source doesn't have -- destroying the target (really
         safely renaming)"},"timestamp":"2014-01-20T15:23:13"}
        snapshots:
                10.1.5.4 (dc 0): 2014-01-13T19:32:08, 2014-01-13T19:32:41, 2014-01-13T19:31:43, 2014-01-13T19:30:34, ...
                10.1.1.4 (dc 0): 2014-01-13T19:32:08, 2014-01-13T19:32:41, 2014-01-13T19:31:43, 2014-01-13T19:30:34, ...
        (old)   10.1.12.4 (dc 1): undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, ...
        (old)   10.1.14.4 (dc 1): 2014-01-13T19:32:41, 2014-01-13T19:31:43, 2014-01-13T19:30:34, 2014-01-13T19:25:19, ...
                10.3.4.4 (dc 2): 2014-01-13T19:32:08, 2014-01-13T19:32:41, 2014-01-13T19:31:43, 2014-01-13T19:30:34, ...
                10.3.3.4 (dc 2): 2014-01-13T19:32:08, 2014-01-13T19:32:41, 2014-01-13T19:31:43, 2014-01-13T19:30:34, ...

    In this case, fix by doing: s.destroy_project(project_id:'306cce9f-fa4a-481b-93ef-afd69a7fb5b4',host:'10.1.14.4',safe:true)

# IDEAS:
