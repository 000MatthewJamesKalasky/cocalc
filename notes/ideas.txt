[ ] from scratch javascript slideshow that is *really* nice -- view source on http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.slide#1

    "It's a tool called Present written by Rob Pike and Andrew Gerrand from the Go team:
     https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/present?repo=talk...
     They gave a presentation about it a couple of weeks ago at the
     Sydney golang meetup. It has an interesting feature where it runs
     a built-in websocket server that can be used to embed code in the
     presentation, and have it compile and execute output directly
     back into the presentation itself. I believe it's similar to the
     tech running behind the play.golang.org site."

    maybe http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery/ too?

   It's amazingly interactive.  *This* (interacting with 3d scenes) is

       [ ] IDEA -- I just realized I could improve "defaults" even more, and do this:
                   interval: required(int)
           where I pass in a type that is required... don't do this now though, since type converting and checking is a slippery and not necessarily sensible slope!
