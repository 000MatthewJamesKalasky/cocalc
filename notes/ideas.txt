[ ] I could easily install the "compute_server" on *any* computer
anywhere... and let certain users access their own infrastructure
through salvus.... for a fee.  This would scale up a lot.

[ ] online collaborative latex editing: https://www.writelatex.com/
    I can do way better, I think, on top of salv.us. But that's for a little later...

    * including external packages, etc.
    * maybe send something besides png?  E.g., svg?  css?

[ ] alternative FOSS emacs-like code editor: http://www.ymacs.org/
    Use for editing files in salvus.  We can have 3 (or maybe 4) options:
    NOTE: I just tried syntax highlihgting a 20,000-line document in ymacs and it died.  Hmm, so that is not scalable.
    Codemirror and Ace work fine with 50,000 lines.  Ace seems faster.
    Keep my eye on Adobe Brackets, which is based on codemirror: https://github.com/adobe/brackets
    Whatever I do for editing full files, just make it easy to swap out/provide multiple alternatives!  Ymacs even if less scalable could be useful to some.
    Ace Editor evidently switched 3 months ago to a BSD license from something more restrictive!!

[ ] insert link will google for options and insert.  (images or links); david ketchinson idea

[ ] google docs editor is very usable -- hide menus/show menus/search the menus; tooltips all give shortcut

[ ] note part of cell -- mode where it is protected/read only.
"I'm imagining it as a cell-by-cell checkbox (perhaps check boxes hidden or hideable
as a menu item?)  It's more as a gentle level of protection against a user of a worksheet
accidentally deleting the written instructions, or modifying them without intending to."
"all existing text boxes are read only (but uncheckable on a one-by-one basis)
all existing text boxes are writeable (but checkable on a one-by-one basis)
default behaviour is text boxes are writeable
default behaviour is "once written once, text box is not writeable
    (so that when I'm writing a project/final I can't screw up a previously set box accidentally)"

[ ] worksheet a JSON structure --> lots of different *views* of this

[ ] from icerm: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vkOxdvjK9iHbReG7CQt5YfG8NG8BLktO_9wBrAmhxKY/edit

[ ] a single worksheet should have multiple tabs

[ ] knowles

[ ] make link to download all of an output cell as a file.

[ ] change "salvus.tex" say to "salvus.stream.tex".
    * ipython has display.YouTubeVideo *
    * display.HTML('<iframe >')

[ ] from scratch javascript slideshow that is *really* nice -- view source on http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.slide#1

    "It's a tool called Present written by Rob Pike and Andrew Gerrand from the Go team:
     https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/present?repo=talk...
     They gave a presentation about it a couple of weeks ago at the
     Sydney golang meetup. It has an interesting feature where it runs
     a built-in websocket server that can be used to embed code in the
     presentation, and have it compile and execute output directly
     back into the presentation itself. I believe it's similar to the
     tech running behind the play.golang.org site."

   It's amazingly interactive.  *This* (interacting with 3d scenes) is

       [ ] IDEA -- I just realized I could improve "defaults" even more, and do this:
                   interval: required(int)
           where I pass in a type that is required... don't do this now though, since type converting and checking is a slippery and not necessarily sensible slope!
