My Thoughts about SD 56 SMC discussions.

 - Chris doesn't think the name is so good... but he is the only one to express such feelings.
 - Collaboration
 - SMC is *totally* frustrating and unusable with a bad network connection.  More so than other things.

     - offline mode... but so many obstructions to that, and loose collaboration.

     - there's many things in the design that could be optimized to make this less painful, e.g., reconnect sends
       the terminal history, but that isn't needed.

 - A million ideas related to homework grading:
   Howerever, it's not at all clear one one clear feature is that's needed.
   To me it seems like a way to assign, collect, organize, e.g., a workflow.
