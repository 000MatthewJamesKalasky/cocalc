= Graphics =

(4:00x)    [ ] attempt very basic 3d rendering using three.js
(1:00?)  [ ] bug -- changing interact control externally does change control, but doesn't re-evaluate function.
@interact
def f(c=Color('blue'), thickness=(1..30)):
    show(plot(sin, color=c, thickness=thickness))
f.thickness=20

= Features =
(0:45?)  [ ] Editor bookmarks?.  Ctrl-B to toggle then, Ctrl-I to move to next?
(1:00x)  [ ] when a local_hub is starting, show a progress meter... (and sequence of messages)
(1:00?)  [ ] check multiple file and drag them in a group to move them.
(0:45?)  [ ] project rename/desc just like file rename

(2:00x)  [ ] write some basic user-oriented documentation (?)


(0:45?)  [ ] it might be nice if open file thing had -- in upper right -- "scratch: [ws] [trm]" icons...?
(0:45?)  [ ] close brackets -- would make editor and notebook nicer, maybe -- http://codemirror.net/addon/edit/closebrackets.js
(1:30?) [ ] Implement a simple "single cell" mode for visitor mode (basically, a sage session, but not using this project)
(1:30x) [ ] Implement a simple homework assignment mode for visitor mode, which lets user do problems, with results getting saved somewhere not-public.
(1:30?) [ ] For easy user-only recover of mistakes, setup rsnapshot
            on the same virtual machine, made with rsync,
            and way to browse it (symlink to path of project)
(1:30?) [ ] When a user logs in and accesses a project (if we haven't already in the last x
	       hours) do a compressed tarball backup of the project.
            Next time, only include files that were modified since the
            last backup by using the options mentioned here:
                http://catlingmindswipe.blogspot.com/2010/02/linux-how-to-incremental-backups-using.html
(1:30?) [ ] Make a new project from a specific backup of project.
             (just show list of times when there were backups made, and sizes)

(1:00?)  [ ] *need* to easily be able to resize the height of the output and have this saved!!!

Other issues

(1:00?) [ ] issue: if you open a #! script the first line isn't read until connecting to the sync session,
        so we don't have any way to know the file type... hence the codemirror editor doesn't have
        the right mode.


(1:00?)  [ ] informal terms of usage -- put up something very short but useful and serious.
(0:45?)  [ ] Do not allow creation of private projects unless users claims to have donated.
