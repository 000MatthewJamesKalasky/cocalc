(1:00?) [ ] ui idea -- it would be nice to mark the active editor tabs when there is activity in them. 

(1:00?) [ ] bug -- when view split, history isn't shared, which is CONFUSING; maybe has something to do with syncdoc since option is set correctly.  Not sure.


(0:45?)  [ ] Clone a project (under settings).

(1:00?)  [ ] When creating a new project, option to choose from a list of users if there is more than one user associated to an account.


(0:45?)  [ ] bug -- delete directory containing a file being edited -- save *appears* to work, but doesn't.
(0:20?)  [ ] bug -- download file with bad URL/failure gives useless error
(0:30?)  [ ] in sign-up: explain that service it currently donation-supported.
(0:45?)  [ ] in settings: ask for money and give link to donate to Sage foundation.
               provide a checkbox that says "I have donated."  When they check it, it changes to a big thanks!


(0:45?)  [ ] cells: move (control-arrow) should move all cells with checkbox checked.  (and control-arrow doesn't work on os x, right?)

(1:00?)  [ ] (0:04 so far) file upload using http://www.dropzonejs.com/; need to accept POST
(0:45?)  [ ] split document editing (see two parts of doc at once): http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#linkedDoc

(1:00?)  [ ] attach: implement the attach command for (backwards) compatibility.
(1:00?)  [ ] option to completely delete a project, irrevocably.   (BIG RED SCARY SERIOUS -- type your name, etc.)

(0:30?)  [ ] show quota info in project settings.
(1:00?)  [ ] make note cells be markdown with $'s for math.  Codemirror editor with syntax highlighting.


(0:30?)  [ ] codemirror editor settings: whether or not lines wrap in codemirror. (apply for both files and worksheets)  apply for both files and worksheets)apply for both files and worksheets)apply for both files and worksheets)apply for both files and worksheets)apply for both files and worksheets)apply for both files and worksheets)apply for both files and worksheets)
(0:20?)  [ ] codemirror editor settings: color scheme
(0:20?)  [ ] codemirror editor settings: auto delete trailing whitespace should be an option in global settings


(0:45?) [ ] sync: global hub needs to also timeout inactive sync sessions.




= Graphics =

(4:00x)    [ ] attempt very basic 3d rendering using three.js
(1:00?)  [ ] bug -- changing interact control externally does change control, but doesn't re-evaluate function.
@interact
def f(c=Color('blue'), thickness=(1..30)):
    show(plot(sin, color=c, thickness=thickness))
f.thickness=20

= Features =
(0:45?)  [ ] Editor bookmarks?.  Ctrl-B to toggle then, Ctrl-I to move to next?
(1:00x)  [ ] when a local_hub is starting, show a progress meter... (and sequence of messages)
(1:00?)  [ ] check multiple file and drag them in a group to move them.
(0:45?)  [ ] project rename/desc just like file rename

(2:00x)  [ ] write some basic user-oriented documentation (?)


(0:45?)  [ ] it might be nice if open file thing had -- in upper right -- "scratch: [ws] [trm]" icons...?
(0:45?)  [ ] close brackets -- would make editor and notebook nicer, maybe -- http://codemirror.net/addon/edit/closebrackets.js
(1:30?) [ ] Implement a simple "single cell" mode for visitor mode (basically, a sage session, but not using this project)
(1:30x) [ ] Implement a simple homework assignment mode for visitor mode, which lets user do problems, with results getting saved somewhere not-public.
(1:30?) [ ] For easy user-only recover of mistakes, setup rsnapshot
            on the same virtual machine, made with rsync,
            and way to browse it (symlink to path of project)
(1:30?) [ ] When a user logs in and accesses a project (if we haven't already in the last x
	       hours) do a compressed tarball backup of the project.
            Next time, only include files that were modified since the
            last backup by using the options mentioned here:
                http://catlingmindswipe.blogspot.com/2010/02/linux-how-to-incremental-backups-using.html
(1:30?) [ ] Make a new project from a specific backup of project.
             (just show list of times when there were backups made, and sizes)

(1:00?)  [ ] *need* to easily be able to resize the height of the output and have this saved!!!
(1:00?) [ ] A project-level chat, in addition to file level -- this gets stored in project_root/.sage-chat

Other issues

(1:00?) [ ] issue: if you open a #! script the first line isn't read until connecting to the sync session,
        so we don't have any way to know the file type... hence the codemirror editor doesn't have
        the right mode.


(1:00?)  [ ] informal terms of usage -- put up something very short but useful and serious.
(0:45?)  [ ] Do not allow creation of private projects unless users claims to have donated.
(1:00?)  [ ] provide a true 100% fullscreen mode for each editor, which covers everything...
(0:30?)  [ ] maybe nice if way to indicate which files (in recent) have unsaved changes??


(0:45?)  [ ] when searching, automatically copy highlighted text into search box.



-----

(1:00?) [ ] when a session has timed out, chat just doesn't work.
            typing once into the session and waiting... makes chat work.


Project =
   - Unix user
   - Sequence of tarballs stored in cassandra db
Each account will have a list of unix users associated to it, starting with *exactly one*.

A unix user = username@host... such that hub can ssh in.
Unix users can be shared with other users of SMC; if a user is shared, then both users of SMC have 100% access to everything.
Database table that lists all projects for a given user.
