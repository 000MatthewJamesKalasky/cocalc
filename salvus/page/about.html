  <h3>What is Salvus?</h3>

<p> I started the Salvus project as a successor to the free
public <a href="http://sagenb.org">Sage Notebook</a> server, which has
over 100,000 accounts, despite frequently failing under load.  The
Salvus webserver software is a complete rewrite from scratch of the
notebook server, with a rethought design, running on hardware at
University of Washington and other providers
(including <a href="http://www.servedby.net/">Servedby.net</a>).  
The
primary goal is to make <a href="http://sagemath.org">Sage</a> and
other sophisticated free open source mathematical software
available to a large number of simultaneous users.
<!-- when salvus has cool features, list them here. -->

<p>I will soon introduce <i>Pro accounts</i> that provide users with
dedicated compute resources for commercial and
research level computations and courses, at a level far above what I
can possibly provide for free.  The revenue from the Pro accounts will
go toward paying for hardware hosting and support improving Salvus and
Sage itself.  If enough users sign up for Pro
accounts, the resulting revenue will enable me to push Sage
development far beyond what I've been able to do using government
grants and volunteer work.

<p>What about <i>source code</i>?  Unlike the Sage notebook, Salvus is a
large distributed web application, not a program designed to run on a
single user's computer.  The commercialization center at University of
Washington imposed a condition that not all of the source code of
Salvus is initially open.  However, I anticipate that much open source
code will eventually come out of the project.
