  <h3>Distributed scalable online mathematical software</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Salvus</i> provides mathematical software as a service: the main user language is Python as provided by
      <a href="http://sagemath.org">Sage</a>, which in turns provides access
      to many other programs.</li>
    <li> <i>Salvus</i> has a distributed and fault tolerant design: it
      runs on hardware located in two separate data centers at
      the <a href="">University of Washington</a>, and on cloud hosting
      providers
      including <a href="http://www.servedby.net/">Servedby.net</a>.</li>
    <li> Many features are planned for the first beta
      release of <i>Salvus</i> in January 2013. These may include version control, simultaneous coordinated
      use by all students in a course, embedding in external websites,
      very long-running and large-memory research computations, and
      mobile clients.
    </li>
<!--    <li> We will also provide custom installation and configuration
      of <i>Salvus</i> on a company's private computers; the price will
      be determined based on the specific needs of the company and its size.</li>
-->
  </ul>

  <h3>Timetable</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Salvus</i> is currently available as an alpha quality
      website, which is undergoing rapid development and may be very
      unstable.  
    <li> The first beta release will be in January 2013.</li>
