  <h3>What is Salvus?</h3>

<p> I started the Salvus project as a successor to the free
public <a href="http://sagenb.org">Sage Notebook</a> server that I
run, which has over 100,000 accounts, despite frequently failing under
load.  Salvus is a completely new implementation of a web notebook,
running on hardware at University of Washington and other providers
(including <a href="http://www.servedby.net/">Servedby.net</a>).  The
primary goal is to make <a href="http://sagemath.org">Sage</a> and
other sophisticated free open source mathematical software such as R,
Octave, and Maxima, available to a large number of simultaneous
users.
<!-- when salvus has cool features, list them here. -->

<p>What about <i>source code</i>?  Salvus is much like Sage, in that
it combines together a large number of open source components with
much new code.  However, the commercialization center at University of
Washington imposed a condition that the complete source code of Salvus
not initially be open source.  However, I anticipate that significant
open source code will eventually come out of the project.


<p>I intend to introduce <i>Pro accounts</i> that provide users with
dedicated compute resources for commercial and
research level computations and courses, at a level far above what I
can possibly provide for free.  The revenue from the Pro accounts will
go toward paying for hardware hosting and support improving Salvus and
Sage itself.  If enough users sign up for Pro
accounts, the resulting revenue will enable me to push Sage
development much harder.
