            <h2>Sage Worksheets</h2>

            <p>    The basic unit of computation in a notebook is a *cell*, which is a triple consisting of a note (or comment), followed by input code, then output.    Any of these three components may be easily hidden or shown, but all are present.  A computation involves a description of *what* is being done in human terms (the note), how to do it in terms of code (the input code), and the result of the computation (the output).  The output may be interactive, and itself contain cells.   A live cell is aware of an associated Sage session.  Sage sessions know nothing about cells, worksheets, etc. -- they simply execute code and have a state.</p>

            <p>    A worksheet is a linearly ordered list of cells.  There is no section or page structure to a worksheet -- it is a single infinitely long page.  All cells share the same Sage compute session.</p>

            <p>    A spreadsheet view is a one way of displaying a worksheet, in which only the *output* is displayed, and the cells are organized in a rectangular array.  Also, clicking on the output, changes the display for that cell to input.</p>

            <p>    A workbook is a collection of worksheets, with additional structure, e.g., chapters, sections, subsections, pages, etc.  A presentation is a linear list of worksheets, where each page is displayed in a free-form layout without the possibility to scroll.  The worksheets (hence cells) in a notebook or presentation all share a common Sage compute session.</p>
