SageMathCloud Project-related Python utility scripts

These are mainly used by SageMathCloud projects.

WARNING: This module assumes you have *Sage* installed -- http://sagemath.org -- and are using its Python.

To run the (probably still miniscule) unit tests:

    sage -python setup.py test

You can install locally:

    sage -pip install --upgrade --user ./
