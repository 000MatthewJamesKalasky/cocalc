To upgrade get the zip, such as:

      mercury-v0.8.0.zip

and unpack it in the assets/ subdirectory.

Then edit assets/javascripts/mercury_loader.js and remove the references to jquery.  That's it.

 * You can delete the non-min'd mercury.js, since that is autogenerated from coffeescript
   and not needed anyways. 

 * You can delete mercury.css (the non-bundle).

In other words, replace these four files:

        assets/javascripts/mercury.min.js
	assets/javascripts/mercury_dialogs.js
        assets/javascripts/mercury_loader.js
        assets/stylesheets/mercury.bundle.css
