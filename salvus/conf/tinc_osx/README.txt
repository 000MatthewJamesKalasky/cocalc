This does not work for some reason -- I don't understand?!

Put the salvus subdirectory as /Library/StartupItems/salvus in order
to make the salvus vpn start automatically on bootup.  You might
have to modify the path to tincd if you are running salvus as a different
user (but you shouldn't do that).
