today:
 [ ] second flask server on different URL that can send interrupt signal
 [ ] socket.io client status
 [ ] pushing creation of new cells out to clients
 [ ] basic mobile client using jquery-mobile
 [ ] new client gets up2date view of all data

DONE:

 [x] indicator that cell is running:
       - only appears after a while
       - css style
 [x] shift-enter makes new line
 [x] javascript eval function that is blocking and doesn't use pipe capture
 [x] delete stderr when exec starts
 [x] tab completion:
    [x]completions of a dotted name. 
    [x] help
    [x] a button so doesn't depend on having a tab key
 [x] add icons to buttons: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/
 [x] make sage command line div of fixed height and scrollable, so 
     it makes sense to have a control bar for it. 
 [x] scroll output into view as it is generated
 [x] send button for cmdline
       - big "send" button appears to the right of focused cell
       - click to evaluate
       - disappears
 [x] execute -- newline button so doesn't depend on having shift-enter
 [x] drag of cells should happen using only the gutter
 [x] when only one completion, should be automatic (made it only return relevant completions...)
 [x] toggle word wrap in codemirror stdout
 [x] make switching themes dynamically possible (?)
 [x] create Document type.
     [x] get it to focus when created or tabbed to
