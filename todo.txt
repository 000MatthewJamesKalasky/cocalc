todo:

BUGS:
 [ ] load(file with . in path breaks)
 [ ] size of opened file incorrect initially
 [ ] worksheet -- the floating button bar should just be on the top
 [ ] autosave for opened files
 [ ] when changing tab back to file editor, scroll must not changing
 [ ] command line sometimes not resized correctly when switch to it, though moving window fixes that.
 [ ] IE8 bugs (socket.io works great!):
    [ ] submitting via Enter does not work in IE8 is command line or worksheet.
    [ ] rename -- doesn't display old filename in box
    [ ] connected indicator slightly covered by tab bar
    [ ] red connecting indicator tiny (missing text)
 [ ] IE7 -- codemirror doesn't work at all, I think.

FEATURES/IDEAS:
 [ ] the menus here look nice (new notebook idea): https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/137850f7b986223e
 [ ] change wrap/unwrap button to a checkbox
 [ ] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3780511/reconnection-of-client-when-server-reboots-in-websocket
 [ ] make the "worksheet" mode I currently have also the exact awesome
     history from the command line.    Use shift-arrows to move to
     previous cells.
 [ ] make background of worksheet div white and visibly so.  Otherwise
     it looks yellow which is funny.
 [ ] connected display should mouseover to give the protocol used. 
 [ ] escape doesn't close dialog for opening new file
 [ ] shouldn't bother submitting exec if not connected.
 [ ] status -- sort variable names should not be case sensitive
 [ ] status -- browsable variables, exactly like in chrome javascript debugger    
 [ ] keyboard shortcut for changing tabs (and of course this must work with sortable).     
 [ ] be able to manually set the mode
 [ ] sortable on command line so that input box can be on top or bottom
 [ ] redo execute_blocking to support sending json message back (so not using stdio at all)
 [ ] different modes of command line:  
        [ ] sage
        [ ] python
        [ ] shell
        [ ] every system that sage interfaces with
        [ ] hookable, so user can create their own (e.g., a game)

 [ ] Implement documents + file browser, mapped to a directory
     [ ] TAB completion! (both in the top line and below)     
     [x] save button
     [x] when opening should load from disk if file there
     [x] better load that supports all of '.sage', '.py', '.pyx' files, etc., etc. -- value added
     [ ] settings:
        [ ] toggle line numbers
        [ ] autoreload checkbox
        -- etc., all in a "gear" popup like in c9.io: http://c9.io/williamstein/bin-scripts
     [ ] support a latex mode, with a pdflatex button -- have the pdf generated on server then downloaded
         either as a pdf or images or whatever (depending on client) -- could be nice on tablets.         

 [ ] in worksheet -- no visual indicator that stuff has scrolled
 [ ] switch to custom scrollbar?: e.g., http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
 [ ] second flask server on different URL that can send interrupt signal
 [ ] pushing creation of new cells out to clients
 [ ] basic mobile client using jquery-mobile
 [ ] new client gets up2date view of all data

DONE:

 [x] confirm on page close
 [x] Change from "command line" to "worksheet"
 [x] Implement a genuine command line
 [x] socket.io client status
 [x] optimization -- don't submit empty input for evaluation!
 [x] the tab bar / command lines must somehow resize
 [x] indicator that cell is running:
       - only appears after a while
       - css style
 [x] shift-enter makes new line
 [x] javascript eval function that is blocking and doesn't use pipe capture
 [x] delete stderr when exec starts
 [x] tab completion:
    [x]completions of a dotted name. 
    [x] help
    [x] a button so doesn't depend on having a tab key
 [x] add icons to buttons: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/
 [x] make sage command line div of fixed height and scrollable, so 
     it makes sense to have a control bar for it. 
 [x] scroll output into view as it is generated
 [x] send button for cmdline
       - big "send" button appears to the right of focused cell
       - click to evaluate
       - disappears
 [x] execute -- newline button so doesn't depend on having shift-enter
 [x] drag of cells should happen using only the gutter
 [x] when only one completion, should be automatic (made it only return relevant completions...)
 [x] toggle word wrap in codemirror stdout
 [x] make switching themes dynamically possible (?)
 [x] create Document type.
     [x] get it to focus when created or tabbed to
